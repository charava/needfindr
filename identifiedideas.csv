A productivity app that feels like a gaming app.,9,"Why are people so productive on their games but not in real life. What if we can make an app that makes you feel that accomplishing real life task is as fun as accomplishing quests in games. And we do this by using the same gaming interface that makes gaming so addictive. Like seeing the completion rate. Getting alot of those encouraging sounds.

I'm not a gamer nor do I use much apps. Correct me if such things already exist. This is some random light bulb moment.",fyje3k
Face touch avoidance watch app,3,"Need a smart watch with a connectable Bluetooth device for opposite hand that can sense when you are putting your hand to your face. It vibrates as a reminder that you are doing it (so that you can avoid doing it and thus reduce virus exposure during flu season or other times when a virus is circulating - just good hygiene habits too).

The wrist without the watch would have a sensor to pick up similar motion and vibrate (but would use the processor on the main watch).

Weird charging case,1,"Yo!

Gravity powered generators,3,"I had thus idea a while back around 2009 when worked at a wood shop and was carrying two 5 gallon buckets of laqour thinner. Anyways I looked it up at the time and there were a coupke results. One was a lamp called Gravia that when you lifted a weight it would fall and spin a rod that had an ( i assume) dc motor connected at the bottom and it lit up. That lamp used a ball screw mechanism to do that.

A company in 2012 had a website for plans to build two huge cylindrical holes in the ground that were some how connected to each other. In each shaft they would have a weight; when one fell it would create a vacuum in the other shaft lifting the other weight to the top as it fell to the bottom. They said that this was achieved with a special device that would ve placed where the two chambers were connected.

I am just throwing this idea out there incase others are interested in experimenting with it. Some might say it cant work or that the ones that do arent that efficient or practical, but just think of the early days of electricity and generators. First electricity was just a novelty playful thing then as more people began to play with it it progressed into the first generator which people had no clue what it could be used for then. All I am saying is give the idea a a chance to develope as we get our hands dirty.",eqwex3

Buses should be delivery vehicles too.,3,"So the ideas i'm hearing from places like amazon and UPS is that they want to use robots to complete the ""last mile"" and ""last 70 feet"" of the delivery process.  It got me thinking.

Buses are a vehicle that often run a scheduled route through many neighbourhoods where deliveries and pickups need to be made.  Theres also peak and off peak times when their uses can be over or under utilized, which becomes a large waste of energy.  They also regularly connect to transportation hubs.  There is also a need to increase revenue to subsidize and lower ridership fees.

So my proposal:   Modify a transit vehicle to have collapsible seating, use the empty space to make off-peak deliveries by smaller robotic vehicles.  Modify transit hubs to also deal with delivery logistics.  Minimize the need for a transit vehicle to only have one purpose, making it struggle to create revenue and good fuel efficiency during off peak times for passengers by allowing robotic deliveries to happen... Which coincidentally is prime delivery times as the recipients are most likely to be home as well.

Build a delivery robot that can navigate a neighbourhood from this transit vehicle, be transported in a compact, efficient and modular way, to a transit stop to a front door, and back (bonus if it can carry a passenger!)  On top of this..  if it can make store pickups it can help retail stores connect with customers faster.

The future of transit needs to take into account ALL of the reasons we need to travel.  Not just be a people mover, but a stuff mover too.

In the longer term, it can be modified to handle loads of a larger size, or for specialized needs, like those in trades and services.  It can even lead to more frequent service, or even transit with more flexible route determination based on rider and package destinations.  The technology is here already, we just need to put the right heads together.",ebr9ps

A way to make android gaming controls more usable and similar to console.,0,"Is there a way to use the movement of your device to trigger onscreen buttons? Let's say you are playing an emulator and the original console controls required the use of 4 different inputs at once. Two thumbs and then a finger on each trigger. Many games use controls like this, and it's why playing shooters on the phone feels so clunky. When using on screen controls you can only use your two thumbs thus making it uncomfortable to properly play. For example take Minecraft. You look and move around with the joysticks, then attack or place blocks with the triggers, enabling you to simulataniously move whilst interacting. This is a critical factor in immersiveness and general playability of the gaming experience. When your control inputs are limited as they are on touchscreen devices, it forces games to adapt and change, often making console ports hard to enjoy, however creating an interesting variety of unique controls for other games that perhaps were originally designed around this flaw.

Specifically targeting emulators and console ports; games not designed around this flaw in controls, in my opinion this side of things could really do with a way of getting around this problem as it would vastly improve the enjoyability of playing (proper) games on the phone. My solution involves using the accelerometer & gyroscope to detect when the phone was being tapped on the top corners or back, and then mapping these input signals to control a touch button on the display, thus creating artificial trigger buttons for your emulator's.

You would simply hold the phone in a landscape position in a similar way to how you would hold a regular gaming controller, with your fingers resting on the top left and right corners of the screen. Just give them a good tap and that's your button. Surely the phones sensors are sensitive enough for that to be enough to trigger an onscreen reaction. Granted, this would not be a perfect solution as it would only really allow you to tap the triggers and not hold them down, however this could surely be somewhat mitigated by using a combination of all of your phones sensors to detect a purposeful input. The microphone would be able to detect a sound transient upon contact, as well as your gyroscope detecting subtle movements in orientation. Perhaps an extremely subtle flick of the phone toward whichever trigger you wish to press, in conjunction with the tap detected by the microphone, would be the best way to grant this method consistentcy as well as true functionality, via the added support of several sensors working together to detect intentional input.

Would this work, and is it already simple and easy to do with apps currently available?",rbs5ja

An App to Organize an Event with complete Strangers,5,"**Minimal Scope of the MVP**

An App that lets user organize or start an event that anyone (a complete stranger) can join. There would be different types of event that can be organized like travel, party, dinner, art exhibit, youtube collab, sports/game, mass gathering, ""for-a-cause"" events and etc. Each type of event will have its own features like for example in a Travel event, an organizer can setup the itineraries, the travel rules, number of participants, contributions/memberships and etc. User can be an ""Organizer"" or a ""Goer"" and their account will have a profile on each type in which they can have their own timeline to post the events they organized or they participated. In each event (as a whole) the goers can rate it like ""it was a flop"", ""I somehow enjoyed it"", ""best experience or it's a blast"" something like that and they can also leave a review in it. Also, the Goers can give ratings and feedback/review to the Organizer on how he/she organized the event as a whole. In addition, depending on an event type (Travel for example) Goers can also give ratings and feedbacks to their fellow Goers. Meaning, they can leave their stories/experiences with their co-Goers as to what kind of event buddy he/she is.

**The Catch**

Now here's the catch, the Goers will not be revealed upon joining. Meaning, they are completely anonymous until they will see each other in the event proper (let me know if this is cool or a dumb feature). This is to avoid different discriminations. As long as the Goer agrees to the rules the organizer has specified and can afford the contributions or expenses of the event, then whatever her/his physical, spiritual or any kind or personal attributes will not be a hindrance from joining an event. Only the Backoffice (admin) will have the Goers and Organizers identity revealed since we plan to avoid fake events and participants. Before a user can create or join an event, the user must be identity verified first in the backoffice (personal data will be private of course).

**Scalability and Marketability**

In my mind I know it would be scalable and marketable since this app plans also to cater reservation systems that can be proposed to establishment owners to include their businesses in the app. Meaning, they will only register their businesses and the will have a panel to handle the reservations. We can also put an ""event commissions"" on events created for a profit. We will also secure the participant's contribution by escrowing it. Meaning, we can only release the contributed amount only if the event is already done. In this feature, an organizer must ensure to cater own event expenses first and will not depend on the contributions. But of course the organizer can view the total event contributions in real-time (if needed). For now, these are the only things that's popping in my head. But I know this can be a huge thing if properly realized.

**Development**

I am a Sr. Developer myself. I have 7 years experience in developing SaaS, Websites and Mobile Apps for different projects. I will create the wireframes of the MVP to start the project.  I only have this idea in my mind and anyone might be interested to collab (in anyway to be a partner), we can further discuss this idea. Just let me know.

Not just any other dating app..,0,"💡Got another app idea, not sure if it’s a thing or not:

A dating app where people leave reviews of you after having dated you (probably should only keep the most recent 3 years or something). Potential prospects could pay more for x-rated details like good/bad in bed (with a summary or detailed passage explanation). You get to rate with stars and you’ll have a rank of 1-5 stars as well as a recommend/wouldn’t recommend dating. Reviews would be kept anonymous. The details would be up to the individual as that’s your choice what you’re willing to share as it could potentially expose who you are.

I wanna 3D chip/PLA printer.,1,"It should be possible to have a 'four color' 3D printer (P,N,Conductor,non-conductor) chip maker that uses chemical vapor deposition to fabricate integrated chips onto pre-made chip blanks.  Maybe more 'colors' for other specialized components, too... for a deluxe model, to integrate capacitors and inductors and such.  Analog circuits come in handy, after all.

I remember a few articles from long ago about someone doing something like making circuits with an inkjet printer, but nothing for well over 20 years since.  I guess those college students graduated and entered the workforce to pay for their college debts.

Anyways, you'd buy bulk chip blanks with pins preset and pre-soldered onto connection points on a piece of bank, clean silicon (or other substrate), and build up chips like a 3D printer makes other models.  It could use pre-doped/mixed compounds as 'wire' for the P/N junctions, metal wire for the conductor, and something else for the non-conductor.  These would be in separate heads/'pens' to be used for the various stages.  The machine would pause, pick up another 'pen' (wire preloaded/threaded) and continue printing the next layer.  (Which would be a nice feature even for pure plastic 3D printers.)

Since it would deposit vapor from heating/arcing/whatever the materials and shooting them at the chip surface, it wouldn't use any chemicals, but it would probably need some kind of vapor catcher for the gases being drawn out of it by the vaccum.  Otherwise, it would be 'clean' compared to the (sometimes) horrific stuff you need to etch with, to make chips.  All additive.  (Or maybe even just specialized plastics?)

So, you'd design the circuit, put it into the software, connecting up the pin inputs/outputs, the software would simulate, recommend reconfigurations and figure out the optimal order of printing, you say OK, and it starts laying down material, layer by layer, just like 3D printers do.

It would be extremely low resolution compared to the techniques measured in nanometers, but for 99% of things outside of cameras and computers and solid state storage, it really doesn't need to be high resolution, nor does it really matter being super fast in every application.  If you're a hobbyist or developer, it should be accessible and a lot more compact and affordable and convenient than buying bulk transistors and other parts, and playing with breadboard when prototyping.  Plus of course, downloading shit and making it for grins.

You could even have the chip blank anchored into the machine in its own chip socket(s), so it could be tested and probed from outside without putting the cap on or opening the machine up.  Though if you built it up pretty high, you'd probably need its own air tent, and a way to reach in and put a custom cap on manually.

When you think about space colonies and replacement parts, do you really want some crucial chip to blow out twice, and then wait half a year (or more) for a replacement you ordered from Earth?

Sure would be nice if you could print up a replacement in a couple of hours without stocking and transporting harmful chemicals.

It could also (conceivably) print chips in 3D, somewhat overcoming the low resolution problems.  If you go for something like 100 micrometer scale, you could still pack a million transistors into one cubic centimeter.  It'd have to be real low power, though.  (Minus losses for purely structural parts and conductors and whatnot.)

Even at 1mm scale, 1000 transistors/elements in a 1cm block would be attainable.  Or print some bigger transistors as amplifiers/drivers, and such.  So making an 8 bit CPU or SOC would need a couple of centimeters of 1mm cubed voxels.  Maybe voids for airflow/cooling, structural elements, a shell and various other things.  Anyway, when talking mid tower desktop PC scale, you could get a non-trivial amount of computer working by PACKING that volume of space, even at such low resolution.  [There are already open source RISC projects.](https://openrisc.io/)  So why not download a new computer?

You're not gonna make much in a day, just like any current 3D print, but you'll get *something*.

Of course, weird, misshapen 3D printed electronics would be fun, too.",r3bwps

My close friends for three years in high school are cutting me off,7,I have three best friends throughout my high school life. After many bad experience with friendship groups and drama. I have finally found my close friends in high school which is my ex three close friends now. How it all started in my opinion and what I’m about to express is what I feel like happened and it could be different on what they have seen or what their side of the story could be. I first met two of my best friends in the end of year 7 when I was bullied with my other toxic friendship groups and when I first met them they were very nice and understanding. They would tell me they would always be here whenever I have problems and they always listened to me complain or rant about my family problems or issues in my life time. I would sometimes make funny jokes like for example how people act and stupid dad jokes. They all laughed and they would always hype me up for the jokes I made and it actually made me happier that someone could finally understand me for who I am. So then my jokes got more funnier and they would laugh more louder. After one year pasted my two close friends made friends with another girl and she joined our group and to be honest at first I disliked her and was jealous of her because she was used to be from the popular group and I hated the way she acted. While I started to feel excluded and left out of the group. So I told my two close friends about how I felt and they completely Ignored my opinion. Pretending nothing has happened. While days kept going on I stoped mentioning my problems about the new girl in our group and started to communicate with her and hang out with her more often thinking then I would be able to fit in more. But as time went she’s actually gorgeous and an out going person and I actually got closer with her more than my other two best friends. The four of us are all having fun and talk together through out our last year of high school. Soon time went out and things started to go down. My problems got worse and I would want people to listen to my thoughts I try not to always complain to them about it and I would often hear them complaining about things in their life’s and I found it equal because that’s what friends do. But then soon I found out that my friends are once again distancing themselves with me. I tired to find reason and I learn from my past mistakes in other friendship groups until I finally said it out to them that I felt left out again. Then they finally all stood up and talked about the problems but it never came to a conclusion because everyone was just crying about the situation and ranting out all my mistakes and they never talked about their own. They told me they are sick of me ranting. They are sick of my jokes because it makes them feel uncomfortable and weird about themselves. But I found it really weird because they never told me instead blaming the problems all on me and telling me how I am the person causing all the dramas in this friendship group. But that’s not my intention to cause drama. I just wanted to make them happy and laugh so all my jokes are just to make them happy when they are upset and my problems I could not talk about it again only if you guys could of told me earlier. Instead of telling me at the end the year when everyone is gonna graduate soon. They said that my problems are affecting their own mental health and it’s killing them and they are sad because they have enough problems on their mind too. But I hate the fact that they didn’t tell me and I asked them that too and what they told me was they hide it away from me thinking they will get judged about their opinions on things if they stated their opinions on things I did or said and it made me really really upset. Because I thought we were all best friends and if we talk about things and if we don’t like it you have to say it out because then none of us will change for the better. It made me feel like a shit head that I am not counted as a friend because they hide their most important thoughts in things away from me. I could still remember that day where all four of us were crying our brains out. But all their problems were targeted towards me that I am the problem and drama causer. That day was the last day of school since the school got shut down the next day because of the coronavirus going on. So none of us get to solve or talk it out. So I send them each are very very important text message and explained my wrong and hope they would accept my apology. But instead they turned really cold to me and started to lash out everything on how I made their life’s horrible and things are never gonna be the same anymore. It’s a build up problem because since year 7 they would laugh in my jokes and told me that they would always listen and be by my side when problems rises and I know people do change over time but these words hurt me the most that my friends are leaving me because of me trying my hardest to fit in. I apologised for what I did in the past to create this problem. But they never apologised for the words they said or called me. That’s what made me sad and proud at the same time. That I admitted what I did wrong in this friendship even though I think I really didn’t because it was a misunderstanding of communication since they NEVER told me what they are thinking. But I can also understand them at the same time because it’s hard to tell one of your friends about this. I admit what I did and I’m proud of that. They didn’t do it and it’s ok because everyone has their own choice. It’s their Choice to do what they think is correct and in the end they decided to cut me of. They said we can acquaintances but every time when I text them like “hi” or “how are you” they Igrone me or leave me on read. I realised that just some things that caused them to turn completely cold to me. I guess In the future I will learn from my mistakes and find a true friend who will understand me better than high school.,g1r9qq
I'm at a crossroads in my life.,3,"As the title describes, I have found myself at a very clear fork in the road as life choices go. If I'm being real, I already know what I should do. That's not what this is about. I'd like very much to just lay out my situation, and get some feedback from the internet at large.  So the novel begins. My boyfriend and I (me:bisexual man, him: gay man) have been together for very nearly 4 years. The beginning of our relationship came at the heels of a devastating tragedy in the form of the loss of a my dearest and longest friend as well as the heartbreak of my very first open guy-and-guy relationship ending in me being ghosted by a long time friend of myself and my family. ""N"" (my current boyfriend and basically the subject of this post) came into my life through tinder, and we fell madly for each other very quickly. But if I'm being honest it was never much of a physical attraction, and in fact I soon found myself being the bottom (yeah we goin there) in my first real gay relationship, even after I fully knew for myself that I was a top and did not enjoy bottoming in any way. Add to all this that my boyfriend was immediately both very possessive, needy and demanding, as well as having an SEVERE anger management issue. For the first 2 or so years he would regularly explode on me, often threatening or actually committing some form of violence on me (pushing, kicking, etc.). Eventually I found my backbone,  kicked back, and things got better. I told him I am not and will never be a bottom, and with that and many other concessions, we eventually found ourselves in a relatively happy, healthy relationship. Until time happened. As we went along, I began to become less and less interested in my partner sexually, and more and more irritated with the way he treated me. Cut to us 3.5 years in, we have managed to stay together but not without at least 3 official break ups in the intervening time. At this point,I love my partner very much, and I want him to be in my life, but I know all too well that I can't spend forever with him, and since he moved his best friend in with us a couple months ago I know for a fact that we've both felt that things are not right and we may be headed in different directions. But then we ignore that ""fight"" and a month later here we are, he spends every moment not at work hangin with his friend in the living room while I hang in our room. I'm just not that social due to my anxiety disorder and I know he'd say I should just hang out there with him but I don't think its crazy for me to say ""hey, I'd rather be in my comfortable lil space and have you hang with me every once in a while there than go sit in the living room awkwardly while you guys chat it up and giggle about inside jokes."" His BF isn't my BF, and I feel like I'm losing a battle that I don't even want to fight. Any and all feedback is appreciated.",fyy9yh
A problem I had for two years,3,"Before I went into middleschool, I was a happy little kid that would always talk to others and make goofy and funny things to make others laugh. Some of the kids that I mess with don't really have a problem with me and sometimes would ask me if I would like to play games in the playground like the floor is lava, tag, and hide n seek. Other kids however (that were mostly girls), saw me as a annoying kid who does dumb things and doesn't know any better. So the girls rarely ever talked to me. Sometimes I would be arguing with some girls since they would act defensive and would sometimes tease for the things I do. Luckily I had a very nice teacher and would diffuse the situation quickly. The girls will sometimes tease me for the things, but it didn't really bother me since me and my friend would always laugh it off. But then, once my elementary days were over and I had to go a middle school for the first time, things got pretty bad.

Once my first day of middle school began, I was sort of shy and didn't really talked that much since my friend from elementary school was going to a different middle school so I had no friends to talk to. My first impression to my classmates wasn't that good, I acted pretty retarded to them as of what I've done to make kids in my elementary school laugh. Once lunch began,
I sat in a small table were couple of my classmates were sitting in. I attempt to make ""funny"" things that I deeply regret doing like eating things of the floor, eating
scraps of food that my classmates didn't want, and make weird jokes that weren't really funny at all. Worst part about my classmates was that some of them were girls that were from my elementary school. The girls didn't really like me at all and started spreading rumors about me that would later destroy my reputation with my classmates. Another bad thing about my classmates is a small group of ghetto kids that weren't really nice to others. Once they heard about the rumors, they pretty much started tormenting me everyday calling me names, stealing some of my belongings, and even sometimes threatening me that they were gonna beat me up. I felt powerless because of them. Around the middle of the school year, everyone was pretty much against me, they all pretended I had some disease which they called Ebola and started physically distancing themselves from me, pretty much causing me to be lonely for the rest of the school year. It gotten so bad to a point where everytime
I sit near to ant of my class, they would scooch away from me or tell to please sit somewhere else. I would also pretend I was sleeping on the table while in reality I was quietly sobbing from all this torment I had to deal
with every day. Onetime one of the ghetto kids was mad at me for something that I can't remember and started calling names and other bs at me. I then snapped and threw a small milk carton at him and it hit him in his. After this, he told me that me and him are going to fight in bathroom. I was pretty mad at him so I pretty much shrugged it off. Then when my class period started he came to my table and told to follow him into the bathroom. I knew what he was doing so told him no. Then he brought his friend and tried to encourage me to follow him to the bathroom. I got angry at him and quietly threw a cuss word at him. He heard me though, and got pissed off and decided to shove my workbook off my desk. Luckily my teacher finally realizes whats going and stopped the ghetto kid from harassing me. But at that point, I hit my breaking point and started sobbing onto the desk. That day was the day were my personality started to drastically change. After my school uear was finally over and I moved on to 7th grade. I was no longer that happy kid that would always attempt to make funny jokes to make other people laugh. I was now just some kid that barely talked to other.

As of writing this now, Im now a lot more energetic than before and now have friends that I would sometimes talk. But I still don't talk that much to others since I fear that they would gonna tell me to shut up or say that they don't care what im talking. Sometimes though, I would fight off my anxiety by telling myself that if they don't care about the things I say, then just move on and say something else. I would also have these episodes where my confidence to do anything just goes down the drain and their will voices of my classmates in my head telling that whatever I was doing is dumb or tell me that my opinions are dumb.

Sorry you had to hear my long ass sob story about me. Hopefully some of yall can give some advice to deal with my anxiety and these episodes I have.",fxkty1
IDEA company,4," Why isn't there a company that invests in ideas? Like raw ideas?

Currently  the first line of investment is held by venture capitals or crowdfundings. But at the very very least they need a grown idea with a  good business plan and nobody is interested in ideas that come from  people who don't have the luxury or the time to get it to those steps.

Imagine  a truck driver. He is driving and he thinks to himself why something  that could help him with a specific situation and this is common amongst  truck drivers? Or a local man in a poor country that sees the potential  that is lying there but no one sees the opportunity and eventually poor  man forgets it and leaves it behind (has happened to me).

Some  people don't have the luxury of resources in rich countries but they do  have great ideas that can make money! It's baffling to me that no  company has been created for this purpose. If I had the money I would've  built it.

On the other hand we have these sham companies that take your money to promote your idea but nothing comes out of it.

I  think to myself if someone had money he would take ideas for free, examine them and if they were good and executable then they give the  person with the idea a portion of the shares of the joint company that  is made to promote and execute that idea.

You'd  think most of it will be useless and people will not generate enough  good material to make profit but see how successful crowdbased platforms  like twitter, facebook, reddit have become. Or how multiplayer gaming  is a good proof with regular people in the action ideas are way better  originated and it will become such a successful business.",rbvnwf
An Idea for a single shot slasher film,0,"An elderly lady pulling her suitcase by its handle approaches the sergeant at the front desk of a police station. She waits until he notices her and asks how he can help her.
She replies ""I have been having a problem with the neighbourhood kids."" She drops her beheaded dead cat on the counter. ""They killed my cat and forced me out of my house.""

The film then plays in reverse following her backwards down the street past the crowds of people going about their lives back through alley ways where she is avoided even by violent criminals and eventually we get to her house now on fire. She enters the house which exploded in flames in reverse. We follow her to a kitchen where she puts food wrapped in newspaper into the suitcase from the countertop. We follow her out of the kitchen where she closet where she retrieved her suitcase. We follow her back to the kitchen where she chops up fresh meat into cuts and wraps them up in newspaper.
She carries meat from the kitchen backward down into a cellar where she dismembers bodies of teenagers fighting them to the death with a meat cleaver who she finds have broken in through a cellar window and are searching for things to take.",rauju0
App that shows how other people would say something:,2,"Almost constantly we hear people respond with boring phrases such as “that’s so cool”, “wow- really” and “not much, you?”. The truth is, this type of dialog is boring and adds nearly nothing to a convo. Most people, even if they’re interested in the conversation, can lack the creativity to say a tailor made reply.

     That is where this app would help change that. A vocabulary of words is no good if they can’t be arranged into a vocabulary of phrases. People will often lack a reply and resort to something they say frequently, then ask themselves: “How else could I have said that?”

     This has the potential be a very good network app- if designed correctly. My vision would be a simplistic and minimalist “Reddit” style chat room, where a phrase or question can be posted between quotations. Other users can then post on the phrase how they would say the phrase in they’re own words.

     Posting responses will give a string of comments in order of the best user rated synonymous phrase. Any question, phrase or one-liner could be posted, helping people improve their vocabulary of things to say daily during conversation.",rf53e7
Collective Bargaining For Prescription Medications / Improve Med Prices,3,"Medication prices are increasing to levels that are not sustainable.  In an ideal world, people come together and negotiate the best prices.  Insurances should be that vehicle and should negotiate better prices for its customers.

But with the current legislation and the allowance of rebates, coupon cards, pharmacy benefit managers, and hidden prices from the end customers, patients are actually seeing higher prices with their insurance copays than what they would pay for if they just paid cash.  Many times people don't know this either (lack of price transparency).  Now this isn't always the case and is dependent on one's insurance plan but this is becoming more of an issue as more people are being pushed into high deductible insurance plans.

My app idea would be for individuals to collectively group together and to purchase mail order prescription medications.

* Groups of patients would join together by prescription medication with individual unit requests (ex: 4 novolog insulin pens)
* Prescriptions would be verified by their physician.
* Pharmacies and/or manufacturers (only licensed and registered medication distributers allowed) would bid on servicing the group's orders - like a tendering for the orders.
* A ""reverse auction"" at regular intervals (ex: every 2 weeks or once a month, depending on demand) would occur where the pharmacy with the lowest bidding price wins servicing the orders. The orders would be mailed to the customers and patients can fill their prescriptions.

Initial Pros/Cons:

* Patients may have to wait longer for their orders to be processed but this would group customers together to collectively bargain for the best prices. If they need the medications sooner, a local pharmacy in today's traditional model can service them better.
* This makes sense for patients who need **scheduled** medications for **long** periods of time. A medication that is of short duration or an urgent need would be better serviced at an individual's local pharmacy
* This would allow individuals to get the cheapest cash prices and even be able to go back to their insurance and submit a claim for coverage, although coverage would ultimately be determined by their insurance and may be denied. In that case, the patient is not using their insurance (or contributing to their deductible) like GoodRx's model.
* This would expose hidden prices of medications and increase transparency to customers and the marketplace.

Request: iOS app that allows you to use iPhone or iPad as Sony Camera monitor through lightning cable,1,"We invest a lot of money in our Sony cameras at all professional tiers, from the under $1,000 mirror less cameras to the big sensor cinema cameras. We also invest a lot of money into our phones and tablets. Then, we spend more to purchase monitors (the ones that attach to your camera, not your computer) that we can use in various ways with our cameras.

The hardware in our iPhones and iPads are more than enough to handle anything a professional monitor could do and even has editing apps that have a lot of the simple editing features that simple videos that only need, like Adobe rush or even iMovie.

In addition, the ability to use the iOS device as an SSD would be amazing too, as it would cut down on a lot of extra steps in workflow and create instant iCloud update. But with all that, the monitor part seems like something that should already exist.

Sony’s imaging edge app is insanely horrible with my a6400 and is missing some of the features that only exist on the camera’s touchscreen for some reason that many of you could definitely explain better than me. I believe this could be because of the camera’s limitations and the fact that it’s through Wi-Fi rather than wired.

Taskified - Gamified Tasks,8,"I was thinking about developing an app with gamification elements for a long time.
couple pf days ago i encountered a problem with my son who didn't want to do some chores and thought about this idea:

a parent - child app where parents can post tasks, each completed task rewards the child who finished it with points, those points can be converted to rewards that parent posted also.

some user stories i thought about:
parent side:
* can assign task to all of his children or an individual.
* can add gifts / rewards to be redeemed with points
* can track task / child proccess
* can assign a deadline for a task


child side:
* can take a task disabling it to other children
* can redeem points to gifts / rewards
* can earn predetermined amount of pts for each day (or maybe day streaks or something)
* earns badges / unlock achievements / leveling up

So, the first part of the title consists on the creation of alternatives to known services. Youtube or Steam and even Reddit for example.

If I go to Youtube for example, I want to search for a specific video. Not be bombarded with tons of images and colors.

Open Source medical research without intellectual property. Etica Protocol,3,"Since 2018 I've been working on the creation of a blockchain *Protocol for* ***Open Source Medical research without intellectual property*** *aka the* **Etica Protocol**. [https://www.eticaprotocol.org](https://www.eticaprotocol.org)

Victor Hugo :  ***""Nothing is More Powerful than an Idea Whose Time has Come""***

I think the time for Etica has come, so let me share a brief presentation of Etica with you.

**Brief presentation:**

Etica aims to promote ***open source medical research without intellectual property***. It incentivizes ***publication of research oriented papers*** (by professionals or not) for each disease added to the network.

Etica protocol has its own currency Etica (*ETI*). The protocol has a fixed inflation of about 2.5% per year. Thanks to this inflation it funds the *curation rewards (for voters)* and *editor rewards (for creators of proposals)*.

It operates based on periods of 7 days. For each period a *curation\_reward* as well as an *editor\_reward* will be issued by the Protocol (respecting the 2.5% yearly inflation rate). For each period all users can submit *Proposals* in order to get a part of the *editor\_reward*  of the period. Etica token holders can submit and vote on proposals  using a staking system (They have to lock Eticas for 28 days in exchange  for ***bosoms***). Bosoms are a unit of measure inherent to the protocol that is used by the voting system. All proposals can be voted upon for ***3 weeks.*** *After the voting duration has been passed the Protocol rewards or penalises participants based on the outcome of the votes.*

The protocol is designed in such a way that **only about 72% of proposals will be accepted**. Thus due to open source competition the creators of proposals will have to **improve the quality of their papers** to get a proposals accepted by the network as things progress

*The  creator of a proposal that was accepted by the network will be rewarded  with a part of the period's editor\_reward that will be proportional to  the amount of Eticas that was used by token holders to vote on the  proposal. If the proposal is rejected, depending on the level of the  rejection the creator of the proposal will have it's stack duration  increased (for instance 65 days) or even lose funds (to submit you have  to put a collateral of 10 ETI that you can lose if proposal is heavily  rejected by the network).*

The  voters that vote on the wining side (can be either accepted or  rejected) will get a part of the curation\_reward proportional to the  amount of Eticas they have used to vote on the proposal. If they vote on  the losing side, their stack will be increased (for instance 84 days  longer) in proportion to the level of rejection.

Full details in the whitepaper.

***The whitepaper:***

The  Etica whitepaper (9 pages) describes how the protocol will operate in  details. (As Published and sent to the original Satoshi Nakamoto mailing  list in September 2019)

[The smart contract:](https://github.com/etica)

The Etica smart contract is on [github/etica](https://github.com/etica). It is a complexe **smart contract that successfully implements everything described in the whitepaper**  in the form of an Ethereum smart contract. If you are a developper or  you know ethereum developpers tell them to review this smart contract. I  have full confidence they will assess the quality of the code.

[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMg5jHjEp59TKy\_0tdoeXnQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMg5jHjEp59TKy_0tdoeXnQ)

Etica is all about open source and **creating a community based project** **with nobody having specific privileges**.  Even if I started to work on Etica alone,  I understand the potential  of this project, it is much bigger than me and to succeed ***it needs to be completely decentralised from day 1***.

This is why I want to underline these facts:

1. I plan to **launch Etica in coming months from scratch as soon as there will be a community**
2. There will be **no premine**
3. Anybody joining Etica will have same rights, aka **I won't have any privilege nor anybody else**
4. It is completely **open source**
5. It is a neutral protocol
6. There is no backdoor Key or Key with specific rights
7. The smart contract will be launched **on its Blockchain (a Fork of Ethereum Proof of work)**
8. The initial supply will be distributed trough mining
9. **Mining will stop forever once we reach 21 Million Eticas (should take several years)**
10. Then only the yearly inflation of 2.5% will generate new Eticas.

Recently I came to know of oil pipelines from Canada to Mexico (and their consequences). And I can’t help but wonder why isn’t there a pipeline of water from states with excessive water (Oregon and Washington, right next to CA) to CA, or anywhere that’s permanently drought?  
I understand there’s significant cost to build and maintain the pipeline but water is much safer than oil and you can always sell water to those farmers who keep crying coz CA can’t give them enough.  
Even when there’s a net loss to the gov, isn’t it worth it to ensure a stable water supply for every resident?",rhk025
Suggestion: a crowd-scourced Panto.,1," Idea:  A pantomime-style play, determined by you lot reading. Every week, I  (or at least, someone) asks for parts of a Panto. After a week, I close  the post and put the best suggestions into a loose story.

Then,  that story goes up for review. It's criticised, suggestions are made,  and changes advised. At the end of the week, the post is closed, changes  made, and put out again.

This is repeated until a good working story is developed. It's then closed for good, and a script is written.

Let's  see if this is a good idea. Comment suggestions for part/s of a panto.  If the post becomes popular, I might make this a good thing.

Let me share 5 ideas with you that were generated by an actual AI,11,"My [side-project](https://ideabot.io/) (powered by AI and managed by me) generated some really interesting ideas, and I think all of them (except the last one) could be built by one person. Who's it gonna be?

1. Who's Stronger: an app for people that work out. You can share e.g how much you bench and see where you are on the leaderboard.
2. An app where runners can join a team of runners. They can track their running progress, share messages about running, achievements, and photos.
3. A new type of social media app on the blockchain where every follower earns you a specific cryptocurrency.
4. A new type of dating app where you have to connect your crypto wallet and you only can talk to those that have the same coins as yourself.
5. A VR game that lets you practice any sports from archery to boxing.

Location based Social Media,1,"Ive hear similar ideas but it makes sense to me now in some environments. A social media where if you are in the predetermined location 'zone' you can upload photos/videos. You can also view anything else others post to that location and set time of event.

Use cases: Parties, weddings, concerts, etc.

This would be similar to snap locations however it is not as private and uses an algorithm/you have to have your snap settings set to public. And the big difference is anyone from any location can see snaps on the map in any desired location.

This would be a more private type of app. You would have to attend in order to see, post, and save.

Edit:

An admin could create the event setting the location zone and time span of the event. This would also prevent people from asking each other to 'share me the photos from the party'.",ri8i4n
Time saving bank card. Skip the faux security. (Idea),1,"Fast cash, Blink bucks, Dosh pass, Fast Chit, Skip Chit

I could make 100 of these names for a card that pretty much skips all of the questions at checkout and just pays mostly for smaller daily purchases.

Obviously first off Chip, NFC, and strip don't put my personal info on the card the limit is low and the security is high.

Skip the signing at restaurants.(Have a preset percentage for tipping you set on an app which can be changed before it clears. Blacklist places it's stupid to tip at)

Skip All the pin pad questions

* Skip the Pin/signing at check out. (Security features below)
* Skip the asking if you want cash back. (Just turn it off for the card)
* Skip the are you sure.
* Skip the do you agree to this fee.(have that one at the local commissary twice in a row now)
* Skip the do you want a stupid warranty for your 3$ bathroom scale.(Looking at you hellmart)
* Skip the donate to a charity (pisses me off anyway I'm not donating to your tax write off why is this a thing that I don't see called out more)
* Skip the receipt completely it goes to your bank. (From there it is with each purchase. Some places offer to send it to your email but about 50% of the time it doesnt pull the email from your card and now all the sudden you have to type it in on that garbage pin pad screen)

Integrate all your rewards cards (Google pay already does this and is fairly fast at walgreens)

Security features to ensure the easy card is not abused since by nature it should be blazing fast to use.All of these should be adjustable and optional features

* Every so often you must tap the card on your phone and the NFT re-enables it or even refills if you have a limit you are nearing.
* Location tracking

1. The card only work if its been near your phone in the last day or so.
2. A push notification if your card is moving too far away from your phone also adjustable distance.
3. Location based security levels highest being that it must be near your phone to work or the limit is reduced significantly. (So you can go in and grab a drink while you left your phone in the car.)

Initially when I thought of this I thought it would be an everyday card with a low daily limit that was fast but with the security options I've laid out this is likely more secure than mose cards. That being said some features to expand past the original scope

Online purchases

* Virtual cards for everything online (All of this can be done with privacy.com)

1. Wanna cancel that subscription but you can't do it online. Screw em the virtual card doesn't exist anymore also if they somehow try to contact you they say you died of  Pentapox or something\*^(Likely not legal) (Should be illegal to allow someone to sign up for a service online but not cancel with the same ease)
2. Same with utilities in small towns that go past greedy human eyes (my electric company compromised my card twice now. No idea if this is just a small town problem)
3. Kinda sketched out by the security of a site just use a one time virtual card

Aesthetic  
Totally pointless but I want it to be a nondescript flat color and have the Skip icon on it.Personalize it all you want just can't add pictures copyright nightmare.

A penis vaporizer to eliminate the need to move to use the bathroom,1,"Okay Reddit, please, hear me out and tell me if you think such a thing is feasible or possible. 

A tube sized vape would be strapped to or suctioned upon the penis. The tube would be separated into two chambers, one a chamber to catch liquid, and the other filled with scented traditional vape juice or ozone. The idea would be that you could urine, in place, wherever you are. The tube would sense itself being filled up, and mix with the traditional scent or ozone to deodorize the smell and begin to vape off the liquid.

Once the tube had cooked off all the urine, it would vibrate in a pattern to let the user know that it was now ready for his next urine.

Children's Shoes with GPS enabled tracking.,1,"One of the biggest issues parents face is the possibly that either a child will go missing, or they will lose them in a crowded area. Many parents have overwhelming anxiety that one day there child will be kidnapped, lost somewhere, or stray too far from home, never to be found. 

I have the idea of children's shoes, enabled with a tracker that can be viewed through a smartphone app. This app would show the location and would allow the parents to immediately alert authorities to their child's location if they are somewhere they shouldn't be. 

My shoes would be water and weather proof, as well as comfortable. They could also be used for elderly patients suffering from mental conditions that wander from time to time.

Need help! Very niche but potentially very important idea for handicap accessibility in water sports.,4,"Idea, followed by back story:

A device that give supplemental oxygen to people likely to lose consciousness or bodily control while in open water.

For sports like surfing, water skiing, jet ski, certain swimming sports, and even rowing, any disorder that causes loss of bodily control can mean certain death, and this excludes a huge number of people from enjoying these sports.

**The best answer I can come up with must be:**

1) portable
2) reliable for oxygen delivery
3) implement some type of ""dead man"" switch
4) be mostly unobtrusive

**Story about why I want to make this:**

I have been madly, deeply falling in love with a wonderful woman, who is a very talented and dedicated surfer. She has won awards and recognition in the sport. A short time ago, she started developing epileptic seizures, and on rare occasion has grand mal seizures that cause temporary loss of consciousness. This was primarily controlled medically, until a short while ago, when she had a series of seizures while on the water. The final time she has such an episode, she nearly drowned. 

This woman is incredible. She is a journalist, a philanthropist, an environmentalist, and activist for social progress, a lover of animals and people, and just incredibly kind and beautiful in every way. She does more for others than most, and she never sweats it. Her biggest joy is spending time on the water, experiencing the ocean, and I think she deserves to have that. I need to figure out a way to make this happen.

**My best idea so far** is a very small supply of scuba air or oxygen, worn on a personal floatation device, with a breather mask, and a ""dead man"" thumb switch to activate flow of air in the event that a plunger is let loose. 

Any better ideas, or ways to implement or improve this idea would mean the world to a woman who deserves every joy the world can offer her, and to me, who doesn't deserve her in my life, and want to bridge that gap with my best efforts to be what she deserves.

I just though about a Sound camera,1,"So it's exactly that, a camera but instead of electromagnetic waves, mechanical waves...

I can't think of any uses for that, but it would be really cool..

somekind of chamber made of sound isolating material. in the back, inside of the chamber many samall microphones that would act as the camera's sensors. and on the front of the chamber a small hole where any outside sound can enter freely: like a pupi.

conceptually it is the same as a ""dark  chamber"" or an actual camera, so Ideally it would produce images in a similar way

a problem that might emerge is the size and sensibility of the microphones. but still, even if we are not capable of producing decernable images, just a proof of concept os really cool! like the relative position of the sound source or something...

let me know what you guys think, does something like this already exists? (I would expect so given that this idea is very easy to come up with) and if there is not something like this, it leads me to think that the idea is just stupid...

People leave me and I don't know why.,3,"It's a long one. Sorry for any typos. 

Okay, so here's my problem. All my life, friends would just leave me, with no explanation. 

One friend I had for 5 years, and who was a part of the family, and my mom loved her like a daughter, left me to hang out with a new girl who dated her brother at the time. I messaged her yesterday (about five years after we stopped hanging out) and told her everything that still bothered me after all those years, and she said it was all my fault and that I must be on drugs to write that stuff to her. I didn't reply to that because she does not deserve it. But she did leave. 

One girl, I really clicked with a year ago, (she is my boyfriend's sister's childhood friend) just stopped texting me or going out for coffee. I have no idea why. Maybe I should ask her, but I'm nervous about it. I don't want hee to assume that I'm clingy or something. 

One girl, for whom I thought was literary my soulmate, changed her attitude when I got a boyfriend. When we started hanging out, I didn't have a boyfriend, neither did she, and we spent every moment together. About 2 years after hanging out, I met my boyfriend. She was happy, she liked him. About 3 months into our relationship, when she realized we were serious, she changed her attitude. I realized something was wrong, but I didn't want to jump to any conclusions. Then I got a job in a city where he lived too, and it all changed. I called her every day after work, and she wouldn' t ask me how I was, how he was, she would just talk about herself. Then we had a huge fight where she said that we're both retarded and deserve each other, that our relationship sucks. We didn't speak for a month and kinda patched it up. Now we talk every 2-3 months, sometimes not even then. I miss her, but whenever I think about what she said to me and how I felt it makes me sick. 

I can't say that I didn't fuck up some of the other friendships I had, because I can't stand when people sneak behind my back or if they patronize me. I'm not perfect and I don't act like I am, but I believe that I didn't hurt nobody, at least not intentionally. 

I don't know what is it about me that makes people leave. Do you think there's something wrong with me?",fwi9uo
Father issues,3,"Hi I’m Henry and I’m 14, I’ll turn 15 later this month.
I get a pretty good amount of support from my friends and family and that’s wonderful. I really love everyone around me. 

Other than the other house I have to go to, my father is on surface level disrespectful to me, and is major subscribed to diet racism/misogyny. But when he and my mom were together he was mentally abusive and manipulative.

In recent years I’ve shown him I don’t like him and I’m cold with him, showing no interest and spending no extra time than I must with him.
But this past year I’ve developed what seems to be father issues. I’ve gotten attached to one of my male teachers, a simple compliment from him means the world to me. He’s the closest thing to a father I have in my life.

I don’t know how to get over this or fix this, I have this craving to just have some deep voiced man say I’m proud of you son.",fuqejk
Should I be mad about my little sister getting things without trying while I have to work my butt off for things?,2,"*sorry for bad grammar and spelling just wanted to rant about this problem I had that came out around an hour ago*
Recently since the new ACNH switch came out I've been begging my parents to get me one and recently my little sister (8years old) suddenly wants it. I kept telling my parents a bunch of reasons why she shouldnt get it for example she broke her charger for her ipad around 4-5+ times last year and also had a replace/fix her ipad a couple times during that same year. I also told my parents I'd they do get her one they would be wasting $300 escpially if I'm correct you cant get warranty and you would have to buy another switch to replace.
So the real problem starts about an hour ago tonight. My sister and my grandma(I have a bad relationship with) talked about the ACNH switch and said to her she'll buy her one with her money tomorrow and told my dad. Over course being in the same room as mu dad I overheard their conversation and got really pissed about it. Since all my sister had todo was tell my grandma to buy her one. While I beg for my parents to try and get me one. What sucks even more is that all my devices like my laptop, games, and a switch(I wanted another one because I am a big fan of the game and the design)  I earned all of those with getting good grades and honor rolls. So I told my dad it was unfair and he said, "" it's your grandma's money and you should be happy for your sister"" And of course I'm pissed cause ik my grandma hates me and I hate her (more into that another time) and my grandma adores my sister.
A week before  I tried to give my sister my old 3ds and a few minutes later to get changed she fricking put my 3ds back on the table and told me it was ugly and wanted the switch. I got pissed because I gave her that 3ds so she could learn if she actually wants the switch or not because I have and also for just 1 game. 
Then yesterday she told my dad when he came home she didnt want the switch then I'm there all happy because I get a chance. Back to present day all the fucking sudden she wants it now.

Is wrong for me to get mad her and should I be happy for her instead?",fsxpxl
"Humans were God's mistake, that's why he created religion and prayer.",1,"I am an Agnostic Theist, just wanted to get that out of the way. And I'll be using He so I don't have to keep saying God. And when I say ""intelligent beings"" I mean living things that are smart enough to contemplate their own existence.

What if there is a God and He decided to create the universe, the laws of science and math, and the ingredients to make life so He could peacefully observe the universe without having to interact. Like what if He created all the laws of science and math and just made the big bang and stopped there to ""sit back and enjoy the show."" And everything after the big bang was just spontaneous ""entertainment"" to Him based on the laws He made? 

But when making the laws and the ingredients for life, He never intended to make life smart enough to contemplate its own existence. But He made a mistake and because of the laws and ingredients He designed and made, humans came to be as a product of evolution, a concept He designed.

Instead of stopping evolution and rewriting the laws He wrote, he decided to write new laws that made an afterlife and made a system or systems to help intelligent life. These systems could be interpreted as Karma and some grand system that interprets prayer and based on Karma and other factors, answered those prayers subtley so God didn't have to interfere anymore. 

He could just lay back again and watch even more. And the reason He didn't rewrite humans and intelligent life out of existence, was because He thought it would make this show we call the universe more interesting.

And since we don't know whether we are the first intelligent beings in the universe, what if this happened first with the first ever intelligent beings on a far away planet, beings that we would consider aliens, and those new laws were in place long before the existence of humans.",rks3go
some sort of place to catalogue internet weirdos,1,"i cannot explain why , but it is very entertaining for me to watch some random youtuber investigating the internet activites of these people , idk i guess its like watching a crime documentary , but the problem is : its kinda difficult to intentionally find these videos , you cant just search ""internet weirdos"" on youtube and get a satisfying result , you can search the name of the person in question , but you would need to know it first , wich is not the case most of the times for me , so the idea that i suggest is : some kind of place where people can catalogue and discover these curious internet dwellers more easily. in this moment , the only thing that i can think about where this idea would work is a wiki page , but people in the comments might know about other places where the idea could be applied to.

Bring your own characters,2,"So, I seen a lot of people wanting their original characters to be real, so I thought of an idea for that.


So you remember that one Cosmo toy, right? 

A little cute robot that learned from you.

so what if there was a think where you could bring your own creations to life.

Here are the steps to bringing your little person to life.




**Step 1.** You draw a picture of how you want your character to look.

**Step 2.** They make it into a plush and give it a skeleton.

**Step 3.** They give you something to help you keep up with it, it's an App.

You can check on their health, smarts and who they can recognize.





**Step 4.** You can give it a personality from 3 personality types.


Normal: they like to learn from you, overall nice, recognizes faces easily.

Stubborn: their dialogue is kind of mean, but alike to normal.

Shy: can't remember names that well, alike to normal.





**Step 5.** you give it a heart (it's what makes it function.) If you remove it, it stops functioning.

**Final Step.** and then you can talk to it, push it over, teach it like your child, play with it, make it cry.


Anyways that's my idea.",rkalcc

"A fully submersible, deep soaking bathtub or hot tub with a breathing tube.",3,"Think back to the cliché in science-fiction where characters are imprisoned, healed, or put in stasis in those glass tubes filled with goop or some other liquid. It’s meant to invoke an eerie or unsettled feeling in the audience, but sometimes when I see them, I think, “that would be a neat idea for a spa, where you can safely cocoon yourself in a personal blissful hot tub.

The first thing to consider for this is obviously, “how are you supposed to breath?” So you would of course use a snorkel that would be preferably connected to an opening on top of the tank, meaning you’re not fully encased and can come come up for more air if you need to, or climb out. The bath should also be small enough for a single person, but spacious enough so that you don’t get claustrophobic. It also doesn’t have to be see-through, so you can have some privacy if you choose to forgo a swimsuit, but there can at least be a window (maybe with a slider you can open and close). Also some lights inside to keep thing lit—ones that glow warm colors to make things serene. And some spa jets. They can even be in-ground instead of large standing stalls or tanks. Oh, and the water doesn’t have to be piping hot, but warm enough to be relaxing.

I kept Googling this concept but couldn’t find anything just like it. I know there are isolation tanks, but it’s just a few inches of salt water where you can only float on the surface, instead of regular bath water you can safely submerge your entire self in without getting psychedelic effects (or drowning in, obviously).

Are there any other thoughts, ideas, concerns, or links to examples of what I described you’d like to share?",c8v042
A Portable handheld gaming PC,1,"So my idea is to get a portable handheld pc, but with an external gpu. Which in theory I believe is possible. (I'm just not sure how much battery power the thing would need to be able to run for a solid amount of time.)  
But basically with an upboard squared, and a mini pcie to pci adapter, I can run a gpu on a tiny computer. And let's say I have a mini gtx1050 ti. Since both have its own cooling system, heat shouldn't be a problem. Only problem I'm stuck on is the size. I'm going to probably spend my summer messing with this idea to see if it can be possible. 

The outcome would be a device similar to a DS. And it would be far, FAR, cheapter than buying a GPD win or a smach z. (At most 250$?) And of course I can get a weaker gpu too! Since the screen size is tiny, no one is going to notice if the graphics are not the greatest. Of course the CPU is something to laugh at, but hey this is mostly intended for gaming anyway! If I could do it the way I want, I would take an i3 raizen or something and slap on a cpu cooler lol.

A carpet lawn.,4,"So as a turtle owner who lives in an apartment I dont have a garden, where my tortoise could enjoy a stroll. 

Just walking on the wooden floor is no fun for it, and  the plants that would be  growing in the garden could be food. 

So the idea is to create a lightweight lawn in a form of carpet with seeds in it.

Inside there would be pipes to circulate hydroponic solution.

Making it work would just require some water, plant nutrients and electricity for water pump.

Such a carpet would be deployed on a balcony ofc.

Bee food!!,2,"Have you ever noticed during high pollen days, the pollen likes to stick to the surface of your car, lawn furniture, basically any metal surface in your yard. How about we create a metal disk that has a wide surface area and keep it in high floral areas. We collect the pollen residue each day (of course this would have to be seasonally made) than synthesize it into a nectar or fine powder. It can be preserved yearly and depending on if a nectar or powder can be given in a fake flower applicator or in a serum into a bee hive directly so the bees can consume and create more honey from the supplement and thus create a bigger output for farmers or more food for wild bees. Sometimes in the winter bees are active but not many flowers are around. This can help nourish those bees and hopefully keep the population up. Through genetic modification, after some study time and science application, antibiotics or vitamins and minerals than can aid in the bees and there hive can be put into the ‘bee food’, or pollen reserves. This of course would affect the honey made but it would be interesting to see what can happen. Maybe it’ll make a harmless honey that can literally aid an asthmatic with resistance to pollen allergies?

Local Sports App (Find me a Court),5,"Hey,

The basic problem that this app would solve is that from my personal experience when I used to go play basketball in the local courts near my area, there would be a problem with the player population that day on the court.

I would usually have no idea how many people would show up and how many would have a basketball with them. Now I did have the phone number of a couple of people and I would just text them to ask but there were many other players that I had no idea of. This resulted in times when there were very few players on the court and and you would just waste time and not have much fun or there was no one with a basketball.

On the other hand there was a opposite problem experienced. I went to a court all ready to play and was welcomed with over 30 people trying to play on the same court. Now again in this case you barely got to play and it was a waste of time in the end.

There seemed to be a mismatch in the court many times, for example after playing just a boring 2 v 2 you would find out that the court a few kilometers away had 6 people playing and you could have played full court with them. Or 30 people were jammed in one court while there were 2 other courts that had barely any players there. Only if there was a way players knew which court to go to to enjoy basketball as per their need.

Now here comes an app which lists all basketball courts near you and you can expand the search area if you can travel further easily (up to you). So now you select a court and get to know it's details like location, court condition and maybe some recent pictures or videos of the court. Next you have the option to select that you are going to play at that court and at what time. Your entry will be recorded and there can be some visual that shows the players that want to play at that court along with their timings. You can look at the player details which would have the player's basic bio data and to make things more interesting you add your skills, what position you play and your physical attributes. You can mention if you play with a team or club.

Value of the App ? Now any basketball player would have a good idea in which court and at what time how many players are attending and this way the courts can be utilized in a far better way with people going to courts according to their needs.

FYI, I do not play myself anymore as I am busy with my job but I do think of the problem I used to have a teenager and think about an app for that problem. This concept can be further expanded to other sports with similar problems e.g football, hockey and tennis.",r6fqzm

An app to say bye when you die,18,"Hi :) 

First of all, sorry for my english, but I would like that someone roast the next idea and I would like to explain it the best I can.

I'm trying to taking care of my Instagram / Twitter / LinkedIn / Facebook / etc. accounts and every day I'm exposing a part of my life to a lot of people that, in some way, is interested on it. 

I made a lot of friends and contacts online (more than in the real life) and it's OK but... What happens when I die? 

I'm sure that it's going to be very difficult that a big part of ""my audience"" know it and I think that I would like to send a last email with my thoughts about life... or publish a last photo on Instagram... or send a last tweet. Don't know !

And here is the idea. An app where you can store and program the last messages that you want to publish to your social media or the last mails that you want to send. You should invite by email the people that you want to have the power of publish / send your last words, and for be able to press ""the red button"" they should send a death certificate.

Ideas to reality ( Honest feedback),4,"So I came to realize having an idea be it an app idea, product idea, or whatever, people always have ideas but to implement it and stay consistent is where the real hustle begins. When you have a team to work with who accepts your idea and works towards the idea it becomes a success. Individuals with great ideas such as in this sub just ignore it after they know that it's just one of the thoughts that pass by in their daily thoughts. Not everyone with a great idea becomes a success and also not everyone with great implementing skills becomes successful. It is when both combine in the right proportion it leads to success

So here's where I am thinking about not letting ideas go to waste. I was thinking of an app where you can list your ideas and people can explore ideas and if they like it can be a part of it by sending a request and once the request is accepted, you can contact the idea creator and discuss and if you feel connected, you can go ahead with the idea to make it to reality.

Dab - Your 3D Avatar Home Phone,1,"I'm at the idea stage but would like to hear your guys input or advice on this idea. You can subscribe at [https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/dab](https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/dab)

&#x200B;

Introducing the Dab.

Your personal home phone for receiving and making calls with 3D Avatars. You will be able to download the Dab app to set up your device, create your 3D Avatar, receive a Dab Number to receive calls, and add friends and family.

You can put the Dab device on your work office desk, at home in the kitchen, living room, or even Bedroom. The Dab device can be your home phone and can be a fun and exciting way to communicate with friends and family without using your cell phone or computer. Imagine how many people would love to answer your phone call so they can see your Avatar :)

You will be able to control your avatar's facial expression with the app and you can send gestures and animations while in the call.

**Voice Assistant**

Danny will be your calling assistant.

You will be able to say commands like ""Hi Danny, call Mike"" and Danny will call Mike.

**Connecting Multiple Devices**

You will be able to connect to different Dab devices in your home or you can use the Dab app instead of the device. The Dab device that is closes to your phone will ring. Also, say if you are having a conversation on the Dab device in the living room but need to go in the kitchen. Your Dab device in the kitchen will automatically come on (If your phone is near it) without ending the call so you can stay connected with your friends or family no matter where you are in your home.

I would love to use something like this for my home and I wouldn't be upset if no one else buys it or if someone takes the idea. It's all about execution. I have a few friends who are 3D Artist, Mechanical/Electrical Engineers and I can get the app MVP developed.

**Would you use this for your home?**

I know that you can use AR Memoji's and Filters on apps but thought it would be great to have your own home device just for receiving or making calls with your customize 3D Avatar. If I do pursue this idea and if everyone wants to use it then I can come out with other features for it. Like, users can create their own voicemail with an animation or Dab For Businesses where you can have a second account with professional attire for receiving incoming calls from businesses and the businesses will have their own AI and work avatars.

I am looking for an application field for a new foil. Imagine you had a foil that can do the following: The whole foil can conduct electricity and seperatly transfer information. You could for example integrate LEDs and control them individually, so you can use it for lighning or even make a display out of it. Another possibility would be to use it as an alarm system, due to many sensors that need electricity as well as information. In addition, there would be a possibility of power plugs, that could be placed anywhere on the foil. Furthermore, the foil could be adapted to individual needs, it is flexible and could be cut in any form and size. The individual elements could be applied as desired. You could also use it outside, due to the fact that it is very robust.

Do you have ideas or suggestions, where the foil could find use? Have you ever been in a situation where this foil would have helped you?",qxi2kd

Military and Luxury Planes that turn into Different Sized Hangers.,1,"\*Hangar 😭

The fuselage *separates and the long halves spread apart along a track* underneath the wing becoming the wall of the hangar. This can even be done rudimentarily with a fuselage that fits together *with large jigsaw puzzle-like teeth* tightly bound together forming a seam running along its length at the bottom and *a locking rod* stuck through the seam of teeth that connects the fuselage.

The rudimentary idea for this is very practical for a minimalistic design. The halves of the fuselage open and run along the track towards the tip of the wings forming a low hangar, which has a prehistoric rock home aesthetic.

This idea has so many applications and tweaks:

Instead of the fuselage separating, legs can simply extend from the tips of the wings and create more of a tent, without walls.

Barn-sized and Hangar-sized airplanes might require smaller fuselages, but that's not problematic:

Implementing joints into the wings of these crafts would allow the airplanes enhanced turning capabilities by tilting their wings. Seeing a large bird aircraft tilt its wings would look intense especially with loose and fast hinge release mechanism, just like how a loose hinge flops around. This flapping and tilting causes the craft to look futuristic and intimidating! Seeing one of these in the sky would be like something you'd see in a movie, and with freaky lights too, it could be really intimidating!

Having airplanes that serve multiple functions like gunship designs or water craft, these birds have a lot of human charm to them I'd love to see come alive in both military and luxury use.

"Bicycle Parking Kiosk (Reorganized, Pitch-Like)",3,"E-bikes are something that almost everyone kinda wants to use.  But what is the biggest thing keeping people from adopting them?

#THEFT

(Well, insanely homicidal motor vehicle drivers are a close second.)

You know in the USA, and many other countries, bicycle theft is a leading pastime of criminals.  Even though an e-bike can qualify as GRAND THEFT (just as bad as stealing a car) in most states, police will practically never bother with such a crime, making it 'practically legal' to steal and vandalize them.  Heck, many times a few parts are stripped, and the whole thing is thrown into a dumpster.  Or may as well be, due to the destructive methods used to extract 'valuable' parts.

There is ebike insurance, but how often can you collect on insurance, then wait up to months for your replacement bike to be delivered, just to have it stolen again?  So your ebike gets stored away somewhere, unused, where it can't be stolen... but why do you even have it now?

Your options are empty iron loops for you to chain your bike to, or nothing at all but what you can improvise to chain your bike to.  Nobody pays attention to bike thieves at all, even as they use huge bolt cutters and angle grinders in public.

Every second you're away from your chained bike is spent worrying about whether it's being stolen right now.

So, how about a bicycle security kiosk?  Give it a roof to somewhat protect the bikes from the weather, and gives the kiosk secure places to mount things, and with remotely monitored (over the internet) video.  Each bicycle spot has its own built-in electronic lock, with an extra-long cable to secure both wheels and frame, with video instructions on-site for how to do it.  Available in multiple sizes, from 4 to 64 parking spots.  Or just add more kiosks as you go.

Plus where these appear, there are one or more mobile vans that show up to investigate suspicious happenings at these kiosks, do 24 hour maintenance, and on-call bicycle service for minor repairs and transportation to qualified bike shops.  If something goes wrong at a kiosk, summon help.  Those vans exist for a reason.  Our cities are full of little vermin who destroy everything.

A kiosk parking slot can be locked and unlocked with the phone or credit card that you used to lock the bike with.  It will turn on an AC outlet over the slot you parked your ebike at, to charge it while you're away.  Buy a parking slot per use, or from a monthly subscription.  With optional additional levels of insurance on your bike, on top of ""we'll make it work again"" insurance.  Show your bike to the camera before you lock it.  Show your bike to the camera after you unlock it.  Or summon the service van for assistance if damage has occurred.

Every grocery store, strip mall, downtown area, mall, office space, public buildings, beach, park, etc. might have this kiosk, offering per-use security and affordable monthly subscriptions for peace of mind.  The foot traffic from the premium security might even make the regular public bike racks more viable as a place to leave your bicycle for a while.  

With the mobile app, you could get notified of disturbances to your bike in the kiosk, with pictures, AND at the same time the service van will be notified to check up, and possibly the police.  Within a relatively short time, these kiosks will get a reputation of being well guarded, with prompt security/police response.  Since imagery of the kiosks is streamed to people monitoring at home, as their jobs.  It goes 'beep', take a look.  Back to your normal internet addictions.  Something happened?  Dispatch alert to the internal forum about something happening, let the vans know.  Let the police know if it's obviously a crime.  HD video constantly recorded in a loop (similar to dash cams), so time before and after a disturbance is captured.

Better than finding your broken lock on the ground where your cargo bike used to be, with half a cart full of groceries.  

Each kiosk will have a small video screen.  For instructions, showing the QR code for the app, local ads, community maps, etc. and confirming/locking/unlocking slots.  AC power outlets over each spot.  A bicycle hoop and lock assembly, to secure the bicycle.  Cameras pointed in several directions to give an overview of the bikes and area around the bikes.  LED lighting to keep everything well lit.  It may flash or give warnings when it's alerting and recording.  Even if the screen gets broken, people with the app or cards will still be able to interact with the system to unlock their own bikes.

Probably the most key thing in the system are the service vans.  Keep the kiosks shiny, clean and functional.  Above all the appearance of active patrol.  One piece of graffiti on a wall attracts a thousand more.  Vandalism has to be cleaned up quick.  Police need to be referred to violations.  People who try to disturb users' bikes MUST be prosecuted.  Security, minor bike repairs and parts, kiosk troubleshooting and repair.

On the back-end, a VPN for the kiosks to live in, and some internet infrastructure for the people who monitor the video to report activity, and get the messages to the vans.

Lots of ways to sell these to a city council or chamber of commerce or people with some extra space in their parking lots.  They don't need tons of infrastructure.  Their own built-in internect connectivity and power.  Just need a little space, hardly more space than any other bicycle parking.  Provide a lit-up place for bicycles at night.  People on bikes are a bit more likely to make other stops on their trips.  Especially when considering the cost of operating an ebike versus a car, or maneuvering it into strange, new places.  The kiosks giving the public a sense of security to leisurely hang around restaurants and shops and theaters without worrying about their ride.",qnwam8
Bicycle Parking Kiosk,4,"An open stall similar to a bus stop.  Roofed with bicycle rack and  very secure integrated bike locks and cables that are opened electronically with your credit card or any RFID card with a 'chip' in it, that matches what you locked it with.  Plenty of illustrated instructions, a clear map of where you are.  Maybe it's just a video screen for this, so yeah, ads.  Battery backup so if power is interrupted, you can still get your bike, at least.

When you lock the bike, it takes your picture.  When you unlock the bike (electronically), it takes your picture.  Motion sensors detect anyone futzing with the bikes and live-stream it to the nearest police (or city, or management) dispatch to record and display.  24 hour cameras from multiple angles and well lit place to put your bike or e-bike.  Maybe even turn on an outlet with your credit card, to charge your e-bike.

Maybe if you lock with your cell phone (and provided app), it will notify you and email pictures of your bike if anyone disturbs it on the rack.  Also integrate with a map app, so you can find where you parked it again, especially in some unfamiliar downtown.

Possibly a part of a bike rental service, which rented out e-bikes and provided extra stalls for other bikes.  Again, rent it with the app, go through the check out inspection procedure.  Keep track of rejected bikes so someone can come out and fix/replace it.  Return the bike at the stall with the check in inspection procedure, including plugging it back in and posing with the bike (both sides) to show its condition.",qnoeaq

Parents that I believe are crazy,1,"Hey fellow Redditors, 
I don't know if my parents are exactly crazy but I needed to know so here it is. Btw I'm 17(f) a few months away from my 18th birthday.
Today I went to work in the morning from 7:00 to 14:00 and after that my father decided to be ""nice"" and ""allowed"" me to watch one online lesson today, two tomorrow before noon and one on Sunday, and then he told me that he expected me to go vacuum my room and wash all the bathrooms, sinks, and mirrors in the house before my mom got home. My mom comes home at 4 so I was a bit pressed on time but apparently she didn't mind that I didn't do what I was supposed to at first so my parents went to get groceries and left me at home and I decided to take a little break, when they came back my mom told me that I should continue relaxing and she went to clean the bathroom, sinks and mirrors herself. When I said that I already promised to do it and was going to in like half an hour she sarcastically said that it's fine and I should just ""continue not doing anything useful"" and then she added that ""it's not like you ever do anything useful"" then my grandfather came to the kitchen where I was sitting and yelled at me about how ungrateful I am and how I'm just wasting time and forcing my mom to do my work and that I always act selfishly like that. Then my father chimed in about how this is not the first time I have disregarded their wishes and ignored my chores. I was angry that they were all yelling at me but not really surprised because they do this almost every weekend exept my grandfather usually doesn't add to this conversation. Then I went and finished what was left and when I came back to the kitchen my father again emphasized that I should have done it as soon as I came back from work and how I should have known better than to delay it since I apparently do nothing useful all day.
I'm sorry for bothering you all but I need to know am I overreacting and am I really that horribly selfish and a horrible daughter.",fqccc5
What should i do? What should i feel?,1,"My question is below the backstory 

Backstory : I have been in many different relationships. I had girlfriends and i had boyfriends, yet i have never been as happy as with this one person. I met him few months ago and we instantly fell in love with each other. We saw it in each others' eyes. It was that shine and that emotion no words could have explained. Then came our relationship. We started off really quickly. We were very atracted to each other and we shared many emotions. We felt comfortable together. So comfortable that he was the first person i ever fully opened sexually to.
After few months of heaven i started to notice that he wasn't feeling as good as i did. We talked many nights and settled that he is afraid of geting into a serious relationship. 
I agreed on not calling it a relationship then, and not calling each others boyfriends. Next few weeks passed calmly but then the tough times came... Coronavirus has appeared and we got seperated by 350 miles. It wasn't the distance that concerned me.
The day he arrived home we talked on the phone, he sounded much happier than with me.
I asked him what he felt like - he said he felt free. 
He was feeling bad with commitment and got scared because of me stepping into his daily life.
Tonight we broke up.

I really love him. He loves me too.

I can't be in opened relationship which is his proposition. I am a romantic, emotional and delicate guy.

I don't know what to do or what to feel like. I would love to try being in this relation with him, because i am afraid of loosing him and yet again being alone. At the same time i am scared of being hurt because of this kind of relation.

Please... Help me",foizri

So my mom was suggesting me to go for a ride with her car. Because I am very scared of Corona virus I politely refused. Then I got shocked. She threatened to punch me and she called me a loser. When she left I burst into tears. Thank god my grandparents were on my side. I was a lot better afterwards.

Girls make no sense: Case example,2,"I'm a sophomore in high school and recently and because I'm not a loser I talk to girls, sometimes, it's not a challenge. However something terrible happened. In my math class, I was seated with 3 other girls in a table group of 4. 

I've sat with them for about 6 months now and every day my confusion and deep annoyance only grows. Initially I thought ""Hell yeah 3 girls this is pretty sweet."" However I was very wrong, it was not sweet at all. 

I had always heard of guys saying how troublesome and confusing girls where and how they couldn't understand their interests and stuff, but I always thought It was just the ""guy"" thing to do and you just kinda had to say you didn't get girls because you where a guy. Turns out I was wrong, kinda.

So we hit it off and our table group develops a friendly group dynamic. So we can be cordial but most the time we are harmlessly being mean to each other just because. However then things began getting weird. These females could just start talking about the boys they like and their relationships and what who said to whoever and other mind-bendingly boring stuff. They could talk for like 40 minutes about just garbage. I realized they where the exception because other girls don't ONLY talk about or as involved in melodrama as these girls do. 

Eventually the teacher kind of gave up on telling them to be quite and only does when she needs to address the class or lecture. Math comes very easily to me and the class goes slow because we have a stupid class, and also they're juniors who managed to fail the class and are repeating. The stupidest people get to set the pace for the whole class unfortunately. So besides studying the girls, I've done other productive things like learn more code, learn more spanish outside of spanish class, etc. 

Anyway that's kinda the context. So the females, they're like a whole other species, they have very different interests, senses of humor, etc. They say things that are totally not funny and laugh about it. I  know it works both ways but I just cannot understand them. 

Now to get specific. I'll start with the best girl. Daniella, she's a transfer student from Spain, she stayed for about 4 months until she had to unfortunately leave, she was smart and nice and her problems which where very similar to the other 2 girls problems where actually interesting. She was mad rich, she had a legit silver rolex and went to a private school. She only came here to learn english and get grounded.  Anyway she's gone but she was great, and it was really cool to hear about the lifestyle she lived.

Anyway the next caste

Ember, Katy, and Ashley

Ember and Katy are both your normal gossipy blonde bitchy girls. Both just talk about boys and makeup and cliche girl stuff. 

Ashley was Daniella's replacement. I was very unsure about her, I was sad to see Daniella get replaced the day after she left. But it turned out Ashley was actually not so bad. She was similar to the other two in that she also was gossipy but she was emotionally and socially smarter. She was also very introspective. Weirdly, she extremely bad at math, even though I considered her the smartest of the girls. 

Anyway Ember made probably the least sense. She had this hearing aid she always wore. I kept telling her it's dangerous because now the government has complete control over one of her senses, and what If someone hacked into it? She would also wear these massive hoop earrings. I hated them. Anytime she wore them I would tell her how goofy they where and how they made no sense. I could fit my head through them. And for her own safety they need to be removed. She never listens to my advice though, I kept on telling her how if she gets near a powerful magnet they are going to tear her ear. 

Ember has been my main concern. She's the most hopeless. Katy is the most bitchy and puts on the ""tough delinquent girl"" act the strongest. But she is the most academic of the girls. She's not terrible if you get to know her.

Ember however is very stupid. One day, she decided to unlearn the rules of basic math. All of a sudden, she didn't understand how negatives worked. She thought a negative minus a negative would result in a more negative number, which it doesn't. However she somehow reached this understanding and had such extreme confidence in it that it was impossible to change her mind without getting the teacher behind me. 

That's when I realized I had to help her with tough love. I so began calling her stupid every chance I got. My hope was she would realize that she is, in fact, stupid. This way at least when she says something stupid, she won't do it with such confidence. Or maybe, after she realizes she's stupid, she will gain the ability to think about the things she says, and hopefully think something like ""oh wait, I need to remember how dumb I am, maybe I should reconsider if what I'm saying is right or if I should say it at all?"" 

Unfortunately I got tired of my efforts going unappreciated, so I stopped. They were also being very mean to me in response, even after I explained my motivations. 

Nothing major has happened recently. I am looking for new soft skills to learn while in class. I need a use for my time.",fevkvz

Laser based system in a few ton space probe may be able to scan some places with few cm resolution from 200 km away,20,"Some ways resolution can be higher than apertures of optics suggest. But a spot on the ground has to be measured from multiple angles. There is already a well known system for radar that is much more accurate than any radar dishes: synthetic aperture radar

There is one calculation about resolution for passive telescopes taking photos of objects illuminated by sunlight. There is other calculation when reflecting radar or laser. 

Short powerful pulses and lots of computing with strange math needed.

For example, a space probe on Mars orbit could scan some selected objects currently seen in photos taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Or a space probe doing a flyby of some strange comet might scan a random patch to get a sense of the texture, to sample the terrain.",re25m6

Detachable shank blade.,1,"Don't know if this is already a thing, but I need to share it with reddit anyways.

When shanking someone, what's the one disadvantage to it? You stab em', take your knife and run off, leaving them to bleed to death. But not everyone take their knife, they sometimes leave it inside the persons wound, making it worse for the shanked. What if on your knife handle there was button that releases the blade, leaving it in the wound. You get to keep your handle, and the person being stabbed gets fucked up even worse than normal.

From a sales POV, we'd sell the knife with extra attachable blades. I don't know if this is a thing, or if it's even possible.",31amfn
App idea: Hybrid chat mobile app,2,"I know mobile chat application is a crowded and dominated space by applications such as Messanger, Wechat, WhatsApp, Viber ect..

App concept:

However, the app would be a hybrid chat mobile app where there would be a regular WhatsApp-like text message UI and also a virtual chatroom similar to what can be found in video games. The user can either use memoji (android/iPhone own emojis) for their virtual character face or select an in house default one (cartoon like). Since it may hard to read conversations from the virtual chat (small text bubbles with the option of expanding them) with large groups, the user would have the possibility to split the screen in half with virtual chat room at the top and regular text message UI at the bottom.

To make the conversation a little more interactive, user would have the option to choose a status (online, away, traveling, sleeping etc..) to let others know and depending on the status selected the avatar would change. For example, if you choose sleeping status your avatar would display as sleeping and so on. In future versions, the user will eventually be able to select among many different type of built-in (cartoon like) virtual backgrounds.

To monetize the app advertising would be used but in order to not disrupt users it would be displayed either on the avatar or in the background. For example: if the ad is for a clothing company, its logo would automatically display on the avatars (for the duration of the contract), if it’s a coffee company the log could either display in the background of the virtual chat room or on one of the props or make avatars hold a cup of coffee with logo on it.

What are your thoughts? Would it be something you would use? Feel free to shoot any additional features or any app name ideas!

Many thanks!",qv0ddw
App for finding other digital nomads and share costs,1,"Nowadays it's not hard to find a job that you can work from home or anywhere in the world. I actually work as a software engineer and traveling across Brazil. The fact is: it's not very cheap to pay it all for yourself: airbnb, food, tours and of course, it's much more fun when there are more people with you.

And for example, when you have to get airbnb and you are alone, you are probably going to get something not very good because the better options are more expensive. This is what i am going through right now. I wish i could get a more sophisticated apartment, closer to the beach, with pool, and other fancy stuff, but the thing is: i don't have anyone to share the bills.

So the idea that i am proposing is, and i don't know if people are going to use it: An app or website to bring these people together, so that they can afford a bigger house, or to contract cleaning services, maybe rent a mansion with other 10 people (each having their own room), i don't know. Since the ""shareable econony"" is a famous term i think i can use it here.

Resuming what i am facing is: i wish i could rent a big mansion, with game room, feel like i am rich and share it with other people.

Would you guys use it? What is your opinion?",qu3k9p
People App,5,"Problem:

* Nowadays we don't see all of the important people in our lives; friends, family and co workers. I used Facebook to see if any important events happened to them but its filled with ads and random posts.
* When we meet new people we don't see everyday it's hard to recall the last conversations. But if you do it shows that you care.

Solution:

* you have a timeline of important events that happened in your life: married, got a dog, bought a house, etc. you can share your timeline with people you trust. Data is never shared outside of your circle.
* Keep track of the last time you talked to them. add notes like 'Adam loves skiing' or 'Josh just went through a tough surgery'.

Value:

* Cross platform - works across all iOS Apple Ecosystem (we'll think about Android later): iPad, iOS, macOS, watchOS and maybe tvOS
* Uses local and iCloud database: everything is secure, you have total control over your data.",qtnynj

Non-Variable Scale-able green/clean energy invention,4,"Hello, I need some help/advice

(I just want to be clear I am NOT asking for any money)I have a friend who has this invention that is in patent pending status, this is something that will change the world. I am not a scientist or smart enough to know how it works, or to describe it in details, all I am trying to do for him is find someone who is interested in this idea. We have been trying to contact Elon Musk about it but that is impossible, also contacting several green energy companies who never get back to us. He's an older guy who doesn't even know what reddit is, so I figured maybe we will have some luck on here which is why I am here posting this and he is not.

It's a Non-Variable Scale-able green/clean energy invention which is what he told me to tell people. It does not need to be plugged into an outlet, or need to run on any gas or fossil fuels, with 3 of them hooked up together it can generate 11.8 volts, he is working with an electrician to get it up to 12 volts.I need help/advice in trying to get this invention some attention and have people look at it because once they do it will blow their mind so if anyone can help out or is interested please let me know.It may sound impossible/ridiculous that he created something that works and does this, but it has been done, it is truly amazing and we need help to find people who are seriously interested in this.I'm going to try and see if he can figure out how to make an account on here and can be apart of this, and actually able to talk about it and contact others.

Wrong place,2,"Well, sorry if that post is long. I got nobody to talk about this and I don't speak english well so I'll try my best since I'm belgian.

Everything begun when I was 4 years old, my dad work in the navy and was often at the other side of the world for his job. My mother work in a restaurant company that have a lot of restaurant in my country so we didn't had a lack of money to live, my sister and I had a lot of present every weeks so we played a lot together. I loved my sister a lot as her big brother and I even learned her to walk (she's two years younger than me).
But everything wasn't always pink, my sister and I are different from other people since we've the Asperger's syndrome (a form of autism). That make that we've a lot of difficulty to understand the other humans and can learn very fast when we want to, our dad has the same thing than us and he knew that we were like him when we were young. So he bring us by people who are specialised with child like us to know how to manage us but our mother weren't okay with that because she wanted that we had a ""normal"" and happy life. My sister and I were diagnosed with the Asperger's syndrome and so we passed some test to know at wich point it was.

Me at 4 years old I had an IQ of 130, my sister at 2 years old 140. She already could speak and do math and had a complete photographic memory. 

Our parents discussed about these results, our dad was very happy and wanted to put us in an specialised school but our mother was a bit horryfied at the tought that we would only study without experimenting a normal life. So our dad put my sister and I in an school with other child of our age but with an experimental program that learned us an foreign language very young. At the age of 5 we had a test to enter the next phase of the program and my father sing me in without my mother knowing it. 

When they got the letter saying that I wasn't accepted because of my hyperactivity even if I had the best scotes my dad phoned to the director of the program and said that the exam wasn't staying an hour on a chair but it was answering questions in different topics in an foreign language. After a few minuts discussing I was accepted. My mother couldn't stand that our dad was putting us in an experimental program like laboratory mices so they divorced but my sister and I entered the program.

I entered in elementary school, all my lessons were in Dutch except the French lesson. The other child in my class were all ""normal"", they weren't ""special"" like me so they learned slowly compared to me and when you're so young you're an alien for the others. 
If you wanted something you had to ask it in dutch even if we hadn't learned the vocabulary yet and the program was tough so we had pretty none vocabulary the first 3 years. And it so that an accident that began the real nightmare happened. I needed to go to toilet but i forgot how to say it, I was 6 years old, hypercative so I wasn't listening a lot in class and the teacher was very strict with me because she knew how I was.
Two hours later, i remembered how to say it. I stood up and walked to the teacher but in the middle of the class it was too much and I pee on myself. Everybody was laughing about me and saying that the alien leaked in the middle of the class. The next day the whole school knew it and at the midtime pause during the lunch some people 5 years above me made me dink pee making me believe that it was apple juice.
It was so that I started being bullied because I'm ""different"". In the beginning I tought that it was only little jokes that was normal between peoples (I knew nothing about social and it was really hard to me to understand, even now I'll turn 20 this summer and I have struggles to communicate).
I lived one week with my mother and the other week with my father, they hated each other and my sister and I, we needed to handle it (insults, manipulation,...). My sister weren't aware of what it was because I protected her as much as possible. She was my little world of purity and cuteness. Always smiling, fragile and pure. A lovely little sister with blue/grey eyes and blond hairs. 
Since she was victim of a rape... I failed.. I couldn't protect her, my dad was on a boat far away and my mother weren't home.. 
Since this day she lost her smile a bit more everyday, her eyes became like mine, completely grey and her hairs became more brown.
She isolated her, played less and less with me. Keeping the secret of her rape during years.
Since that happen I became more and more aware of the world around me, how people (even adults) treated me like an alien or a genius. I learned that well when I had an accident and needed a surgery that was 8 hours long or I couldn't walk anymore. Gracefully this accident also happened when my dad was in mission so the army paid the best surgeons to opperate me  because they were responsible for my security when my dad was in mission.
The years passed and the situation got worse. My dad and mother became alcoholic because my sister talked about her rape. My dad couldn't find a stable relationship and so living with him became like managing a child when you're 8.
I got bullied from my 6 years old to my 15 years old. I couldn't get out of the experimental program since I was too precious with my results so I was forced to stay with my bullyers until the end of my scholarship.
I became depressed at 9, went to the psychologist for 4 years but nothing worked and I made 2 psychologist depressed so nobody wanted to listen to me since I was a ""special case of young child with the maturity of an old man"". Some people even said of me that it was like I made the world war when I talked. 

My dad said me horrible things, that I was responsible of all his problems. That my behavior bringed all the problems that destroyed him. My mother was more gentle with me and managed everything so that I could have a better life, enjoying a bit my child life. For that I'm going to thank her forever.
But that didn't last long.
When I was 10 my dad met a women that had 4 girls. I lived a constant nightmare during 5 years. It was so hard to live that I tried twice to kill myself bit the both times I stopped right before I died because I tought that I must stay alive for my mom and my sister. I forced my sister to live exclusively by my mom and managed to make a trial against my father to live by my mom except for 2 weekends a month and the half of the holydays. 
Between my 15 and 18th anniversary a lot of things happened. Since I lost my virginity when I was 12 a lot of my """"""""""friends"""""""""" asked my help to have girlfriends or how to begin a sexual life without too much problems and how to handle it. I became to get integrate in the class and made my first real friendly relationships (at least I tought) so I learned psychology and how to handle friends. 
I begun to teach lessons after the school in an class near the study room of the school during 2 years, I helped as much as possible everyone who didn't understood something and I even went to some of them's houses around 10PM the days before exams to help them. I managed this, I listenned to their problems sometimes late in the night and helped them to solve it, I litteraly carried 20 lifes that were for me nothing but simple compared to mine and one day I fell on the ground after my day at school. I went back home, said ""Hi mom! How was your day?"" (I didn't saw her a llt because at this moment she worked 60 hours a week because we were 4 to live in the house and life became extremely expensive) and I fell appart. I made a burn-out when I was 16 years old. I stopped teaching in the classroom after the school and helped only one girl with teaching because I knew that without me she wouldn't pass her exams. (Actually she's studying to become social worker because I inspired her.)
After this my depression got worse and worse because my mother didn't stand under the pressure of her work and became more and more alcoholic.
My father's mind fell apart so I went back by him to help him. I graduated from the experimental program and my mother met her first love back. We moved out (I moved out at least 8 times during my life actually) by his house and I tried university in biology...

I think that life want me to suffer because I fell in love with a girl that was perfect, she listenned to my and the story of my life, I listenned to her and we got in couple. In december 2018 my grandfather had an cerebrovascular accident right before christmas and my exams in january. I move by my father because he lived closer to the University and so I could sleep more than 4 hours per night. Even tough i studied as I could but don't passed any exams. 3 month later my girlfriend lost two of her grand parents and by my side my father tried to kill himself, I arrived in time to stop him and he went to the hospital. I lived alone in a big house for 2 month, it was hard with the pressure of the university, my girlfriend depressed with the lost of their grand parents and my father in the hospital after an attempt to kill himself. The result: I said something horrible without noticing it directly and didn't erase the message at time (on messenger) so she broke with me right before the exams in july... I passed 2 exams on the 9. I was close for some of them with 9.8/20 but I was too tired.. Exhausted of this life and I said fuck off to the university. I had nobody to help me, I was and am alone since I'm born. Without anybody to try to understand me. I'm now learning in computing and programming since I think like a computer. A couple of days ago I lost my grandfather, he finally died after 2 years of dying slowly in the hospital. Everytimes saying to me that he suffer. My dad is always alcoholic, my mom have a better life since I left her home so I don't want to bother her with my problems (I already tried and it was catastrophic). My best-friend has his problems and I can't ask him help. My sister is rebuilding herself slightly. And me I'm carrying my whole family even if I'm completely broken in pieces. I can't cry anymore even if I want or need it. A lot of things have the taste of blood, my vision often goes dark and nothing brings me fun. I'm bored constantly. 

Here I resumed my life, I didn't tell everything. It would take a lot of time. Too much time.

If you read this thank you, it already helped me a bit. At least I hope it because I'm so stressed and depressed that I lost sleep years ago. 

This world sucks, I've been born in the wrong time or in the wrong world. I don't enjoy anything anymore and sometimes I get lost in my dreams of another world where I can finally feel peace in my heart and mind. That's the last thing that make me cry..

I Had a fight with my dad,4,"Let me lay it out for you all. I am 24 still living at home with my parents still looking for work. Been on and off jobs for the last year not in a financial position to move out yet. Want to be a full time writer and been doing well to build up a following, been working on my craft and decided to go to uni, starting this year. 
Considering i pay rent agreed between my father and I, and pay for my own rego, insurance, clothes, things i want or need, the only thing my rent contributes is food, electricity and water. I help around the house, do what needs to be done and apply for jobs still. He believes he can dictate what i can and can't do because i am in his words living under his roof and his word is always law. I believe that no longer applies to modern times. It is my house just as it is my siblings, my mums and his.
My dad, he's a boomer, doesn't believe you have to apply online, goes with '""call them up or walk in to speak with manager or call after the interview and do a follow up."" Thinks I have to be out of the house, believes that i should no longer be here cause of my age. I am in his eyes a financial burden.
Now my sister, she's a full time uni student learning to be a dr. She turns 20 this year, doesn't pay rent, rego, insurance, all of that is covered by dad as he agreed to do so and stated he would have done the same if i went into uni straight from highschool. My parents run a business and my sister works the small hrs she is given and hold tight onto that money. Spending it more on her GF than anything. 
All of this is frustrating as dad doesn't approve with my choice to be a writer. He doesn't approve of the course i had chosen, he's not supportive of anything i do, and throws back in my face that he helped me get jobs and how i should be thanking him and blaming me for cocking it up. I gave them my best, many admired that i got up everyday and go to work despite the bullying that went on and still he deemed as ""she could have done better.""
The argument: I clapped back at my dad, trying to lecture me on how to be an adult, how i should work like him because he chose to buy a business and do shit for it, he hates that i have free time and tries to offload more things onto me when there is no need. I have three younger siblings who do less than me. Says he's the only one with a job yet my mum runs the business from home. Stated my sister doesn't pay rent i and i do, as well with rego and insurance and she doesnt pay a cent. Telling me i should get a job, yet i have been applying for months, tell me to move out and so i throw back why i should, putting my foot down telling him he does not dictate my life or my sisters lives and that i do what needs to be done in the house, pay for rent and help when its needed, therefore he shouldn't have a say about anything i do.
In the end he says I'm going to get a rude shock and found out later he plans to make me pay for a sixth of everything. I'm not going to let it happen.
I am sorry for the long post but i wanted to tell someone. Its the first time where i have stood up for myself as my father has been controlling of me for a very long time.",fblmhv

Virtual chat mobile app idea,0,"The mobile app would be a chat app with WhatsApp like functionalities. The only difference is that the conversation screen would be a virtual room similar to video games like chat rooms. Each user will create their own virtual character using the memojis technology built into smartphones upon login into the app (future state could be in-house development of custom virtual characters).   
To make the conversation more interactive, user would have the option to choose statuses (online, away, traveling, sleeping etc..) to let other contacts know about your availability. Depending on the status selected the virtual character would change accordingly. For example, if you choose sleeping status your avatar would display as sleeping and so on.   
To monetize the app advertising could be used but in order to not disrupt users with popups and whatnot the ads would be displayed either on the memojis character itself or in the conversation background. For example: if the ad is for a clothing company, its logo would automatically display on all the characters (for the duration of the contract). Another monetization stream could be the sale of virtual characters' skins like in video games.   
Any feedback is welcome!

My Product Today Discuss The ABC’s of Successfully Getting Your Product Ready for TV,0,"“You can have the greatest product, service or idea in the world. But, if you don’t get it in front of the right people at the right time, you have nothing.”   - Bob Circosta  


When you think about TV shopping, names like OxyClean, Chia Pet , PedEgg and Snuggie might come to mind. And while all of these products, all inventions of the last 50 years, seem to be as different as night and day, they do all have one very important commonality: all of these products were introduced to the consumer using direct response television, or DRTV.  


So what exactly is DRTV? It is simply television advertising that directs the consumer to react immediately to purchase a product or service, usually by phone or through a webpage. In other words, it’s the infomercials and home shopping channels you see on TV every day. And while it may get irritating being interrupted in the middle of a favorite show, DRTV works.  


I’m sure you remember the commercials for all the products I just mentioned. I mean who could forget the Cha-Cha-Cha Chia jingle, or grass stain removal demonstration showing the power of OxyClean, or all the testimonials of super- soft soles after watching countless people scrub their feet with the PedEgg?  


Because of the successful marketing to the masses via TV, each of these products has become a household name. You no longer have to order them over the phone or online after seeing a commercial. Jump in your car right now and drive to your local supercenter. You’ll see them lining the shelves.  


Yes, the TV is a powerful medium. After all, there are 302 million household television sets in the U.S. and the average American spends approximately 5 hours a day watching one. In my house it seems there is always a television on in any given room, whether it’s being watched or not. I’m guilty of using the tube for background noise every day. So whether we’re conscious of it or not, we are constantly being inundated by information spewing from the television. In fact, nearly two-thirds of all Americans report regularly seeing infomercials, which is good for sales since, on average, viewers have to see an infomercial at least three times before the final purchase decision is made.  


As an inventor you probably dream of one day seeing your product on TV, whether in spot ads (30-60 second commercials), in longer segments like an infomercial, or on a television shopping channel, such as HSN, QVC or Shop NBC.  


You’ve seen proof with products such as the Snuggie TM and Chia Pet TM that your own idea can indeed one day be seen on TV. And if you market to the right masses, your product could be one of the more than 1,000 different products being sold to a reported one out of every four Americans through DRTV each year.  


If these numbers aren’t enough to convince you of the effectiveness of DRTV, consider the following: In an average month, 300,000 infomercial spots appear on approximately 36 national cable stations and 1,800 broadcast stations, according to Elissa Myers, president of The Electronic Retailing Association (ERA). HSN alone delivers an assortment of exclusive products, broadcasting live 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 364 days a year, reaching approximately 96 million homes.  


Today, home shopping is so popular that it has become a 12 billion dollar industry in the U.S. And because people keep tuning in to find and buy the latest and greatest products, product placement on home shopping channels has become extremely competitive.  


After asking “TV’s Billion Dollar Man”, Bob Circosta, tips on how to get a new product on TV, I’ve learned that television shopping channels are looking for products that are currently manufactured and ready to go. An idea is one thing; a finished product, another. Your product has to be ready to be bought in order for it to sell.  


Yes, the thought is daunting. But don’t for one second think the PedEggTM, SnuggieTM or Chia PetTM was anything but a dream.  


You may be feeling overwhelmed, thinking there are a billion steps to take getting from A (conception) to Z (seeing your product sell). And, quite frankly, there are; being an inventor is no joke—something you know already. Each day you find a different set of obstacles to face head-on and overcome. I doubt there is an inventor out there who has never considered throwing in the towel. Despite upset after upset, successful inventors are those who maintain focus and never lose site of the finish line.  


“I believe there is one driving force in making any dream come true—and that’s you,” says Circosta, who sees success stories of inventors every day. “Don’t accept what you have,” he advises, “expect what you want. All this expectation starts in the form of a dream.”  


So just how do you keep your mind on the right path? Throughout Circosta’s experience, he has taken notice of three core focal points that thriving entrepreneurs share. He calls them the A-B-C’s of success: Attitude, Belief, and Commitment.  


Attitude  
We’ve all heard before that attitude is everything. Well, it is. The world is full of Debbie Downers, people who try to discourage us by focusing on why our ideas won’t work. As an inventor, you need to learn to block out the negativity.  


“Don’t ever let anyone else tell you what you cannot do,” says Circosta. “Once we have established our dream, we come to the realization that it takes an enormous amount of energy to make that dream come alive. If we are surrounded by people that are not helping us feed our dream, then these people become energy-drainers in our lives.”  


So often an inventor will abandon an idea because of a minor hiccup, thinking, So-and-so was right. This was a bad idea. It might seem easier to give into the discouraging words than to persevere. Don’t get caught in this trap.  


To maintain your positive attitude, Circosta suggests you focus on one big reason why your idea will work. Anytime you’re faced with opposition, you can think back on this reason while imagining the contributions you’ll be making to others’ lives once your idea becomes a working product.  


Belief  


One of my favorite quotes of all time was spoken by Sophia Loren. She said, “Nothing makes a woman more beautiful than the belief that she is beautiful.”  


You’re probably wondering, “Just what does this have to do with me, an inventor?”  


Let’s take a moment to consider the idea from Circosta’s viewpoint. He says:  


Belief in something means having confidence. Having confidence allows people to perceive you as genuine. Being genuine makes you credible. And credibility is everything to the success of a sale—whether it’s an idea or a product being sold.  


Who would catch your eye on the street? A person walking tall, chin up? Or someone with slouched shoulders, staring at the ground? The bottom line is: if you don’t believe it yourself, no one else will.  


This is not saying you have to exude arrogance. Always remember: you need to embrace resilience. If you accept that nothing is going to go exactly as planned, that there could be setbacks early on, you will be much better prepared to face any bump in the road—without a chance of bottoming out. If you continue to believe in yourself and your idea the horizon will seem a lot closer.  


And, even though it may be hard to hear, if you don’t believe 100% that your product is feasible, perhaps it’s time to shift your focus to something new.  
Commitment  


Commitment is all about having a never-say-die mindset. As previously mentioned, you will encounter roadblocks, but you have to commit to turning your dream into a reality no matter how difficult it gets. When the going gets tough, the tough get going, right?  


In his training sessions held around the country, Circosta often asks his audience why the household cleaner “Formula 409” has that name. It’s because the first 408 formulas weren’t as effective.  


You might not have to try 408 different times to get your product perfect, but chances are you won’t get it on the first try. Even knowing where to start can be a challenge. Before you dive head first into your idea, spend some time thinking about your goals, researching what you have to do to achieve these goals and then document all of the steps you’ll need to take to get there. For example, what kind of licensing do you want to obtain? When does this need to be done? What about prototyping? Do you need a prototype to get a trademark? Figure out the details then create a schedule for yourself.  


***“Without a well-documented course of action, inventors tend to lose sight of where they’re headed. They start to get overwhelmed about knowing what steps to take next,” says Ricardo Valderrama, CEO at*** [My Product Today](https://myproduct.today/)***, a US based firm specializing in assisting inventors get their products to market. “It’s always a good idea to take the time to make a detailed plan.”***  


I’m sure you’ll agree it’s much easier to follow through with a commitment if you have a plan.  


So as you get your product ready for TV, always remember what Circosta says, “your will is more important than your skill.” And your attitude, belief and commitment are major players in your journey to success.

A new kind of jewelry,0,"Hi everyone! I’m working on this idea of combining nanotechnology, books and jewelry. I’m a nanotechnology engineer and technology today allows to minimize everything, and books are no exception. Some of us have a favorite book or a story that influenced our life. Since, I believe, we are nostalgic/spiritual beings, keeping that book close can have a positive impact on my day to day life. 
Since this is a proof of concept, I decided to start with the most read/owned book, which is the Bible. You’re welcome to have a look at it here ([website](kjvnano.com)). 
Practically, it is a Bible you can have with you at all times, in nice a pendant. 
Would like to hear your thoughts on this, and suggestions/ideas on additional books (non-religious) that might make sense to transform in to similar wearable pendant.

[App Idea] Alternative Product App. Boycott with choice and precision.,0,"To begin, Our Next Arc is a movement. We make no money, not even from donations. 

We are done doing business with entities that destroy our planet, ruin lives, and murder to protect profit. We are doing all we can to fight back and an app like this will be an invaluable tool.

If you can build it, then do it. Take full credit. We don't care. This isn't about us - this is about having a tool to fight back against destructive corporations and their financiers in a meaningful way. All that said, let's get to it.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In order to help consumers break away from businesses that have committed atrocities, we need to make it easy for them to find alternatives to products from companies that are more ethical. 

Sustainability is great, but it's not our primary focus. Our larger focus is on draining business away from places like Nestle, Blackrock, etc, so that money can get into the hands of businesses that willingly do better. Sustainability is inevitable as a part of being an ethical business and will come in time - but it needs funding and this will help them get it.

The idea is for an ""Alternative Product Finder"" app that leads consumers to these better products/businesses/services. There are examples of apps that ALMOST get there, but don't go all the way as we need in being selective about who the alternatives are.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

App Function:

1) Any barcode can be scanned

2) Complete information is displayed about the product . This would be similar to:

[https://www.barcodelookup.com/](https://www.barcodelookup.com/) App that lets you scan 300mil barcodes and get info on the products

[https://www.programmableweb.com/api/open-eangtin-database](https://www.programmableweb.com/api/open-eangtin-database) is an API claiming it allows you to scan/search barcodes to find alternatives as well. No clue how to put this to use.

3) Alternative products are displayed. For ONA's purposes, these alternatives will be carefully selected to only display alternatives belonging to companies with a good reputation. In overall function, a close example is:

[https://alternativeto.net/](https://alternativeto.net/) Great site that lists alternatives to software and apps

4) Barcodes not in the database can be added by the user and then vetted by ONA to ensure it's a company we should support

5) App is free

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

How hard would this be? What would be needed?

I challenge anyone capable of doing this, go ahead and do it. Just let us know when you've done it so we can put it to use and promote it as much as possible. 

This isn't about me or ONA - this is about making a tool readily available to the public so we can start to fight back with our choices in how we spend our money. Please make this if you're capable and willing. We need you to do build this. You need you to build this.",rmcpjg

Your All-in-one Off-grid Power Solution | Solar Generators,2,"[BLUETTI](https://www.bluettipower.com/) is so much more than just a brand name; it is a way of life, a design philosophy, our hope for a better earth, a blue sky, and much more.

&#x200B;

From a single idea - a portable, powerful source of electricity - we've built out a whole line up of solar power storage products for adventurers and all kinds of off-grid lives..

&#x200B;

[BLUETTI](https://www.bluettipower.com/) Power Inc, based in Les Vegas, is the leading world manufacturer of solar energy facilities including solar generators, photovoltaic panels, and related accessories. Its energetic residential power stations launched in the past two years-AC200P, EP500, and AC300 have stood out from the promising solar solution market, and now it ventures to integrate the innovative sodium-ion battery technology into its upcoming solar products.

&#x200B;

Recently [BLUETTI](https://www.bluettipower.com/) has announced the world’s first sodium-ion solar generator-NA300 and its compatible battery pack - B480 on its social medias

&#x200B;

It is said that the NA300 and B480 seamlessly inherit all the style and appearance settings of its predecessor – EP500 Pro, especially four 20A plugs and one 30A L14-30 output ports driven by the built-in 3,000W pure sine wave inverter to juice up most household electrical appliances. Besides, the NA300 further outstrips the EP500 Pro’s incredible 2,400W solar input to 3,000W. It may be cited to be the fastest charging solar generator since it can be recharged from 0% to 80% in a short half-hour by 6,000W swift AC + PV dual charging. (3,000W Max. for both AC and PV)

However, NA300 provides a capacity of 3,000Wh, less than the 5,100Wh of EP500 Pro in the same size owing to the current sodium-ion battery technology limitations. Favorably, it supports up to two B480 battery modules (4,800Wh each) for a whopping total capacity of 12,600Wh, and the unit can sustain the constant supply for a family electricity needs for several days or even a week in grid failures or natural disasters with recharging by the solar panels. Additionally, NA300 also offers the 240V, 6000W connection with a Fusion Box and another NA300, IoT App Remote Control by iOS or Android, and other EP500 Pro’s merits.

[Bluetti](https://www.bluettipower.com/) is and always will prioritize design, service, and quality over everything else. One of the most important aspects to us when designing new products is that we use the highest quality, longest-lasting materials available.

"3 ways to move (mouse) cursor: knob wheels for x and y direction, direction wheel + speed slider and buttons for fast and slow move",1,"Different mouse controls for different uses and for different software. Computer in a moving car may benefit from different physical user interface than tabletop or lap.

Knobs for height and width give precision. Some software, like Blender 3D has 3d cursor that could use knob for depth too, so there is x, y and z axis control. 

For some use, knob could point angle from 0 to 360. Other knob, slider or buttons could control speed of cursor movement to that direction. 

One possibility is to have direction buttons for both fast and slow movement and mid-angles, like this:

An mental health support app for people that go to the same school,1,"So school shootings have been a huge problem, and so has the increase in student suicides and mental health issues.

Different chat groups for different things (eating disorders, anxiety, depression, etc.) So students can feel more connected to their community.

Community Aide/Emergency App,1,"What if you have an emergency and need assistance faster than the police and medics can get to you? So how about there be a way for people in all communities to opt in to helping in the event of an emergency? Then, 911 dispatch could alert your nearest neighbor(s) to come to your aid. Or you could even opt to open said app and request emergency assistance from the community yourself. Would need to have a loud alert much like the amber alerts so it can be heard regardless of the time. Could also give people the option to only be available during certain hours as well as set times/days away. This would create community togetherness and help in many different situations in which police/medics take 20+ minutes to respond.",rskwi7
Political War Social Media App,3,"Increasingly, over the last few year, I noticed that people regard their political beliefs more like teams than actual thought-out ideas. Similar to football fans, they hate the other team and support their team no matter what. Then, why not capitalize on it? Twitter kinda does it but in half-assed way. 

So, my idea is to create a social media app where you can follow your favorite political teams such as (Communism, Anarchism, Conservatism, Populism, etc) and concurrent news will be presented daily. Each team has a forum where they provide their opinion on the matter at hand. Then, for each news story, you can check the most voted opinion from each team which will kinda act like the voice of the team. Therefore, other teams can provide a rebuttal to the to top most voted opinions from other teams and fight. 

Opinions are not limited to comments, but also short videos explaining their opinion on the news. 

Obviously, in terms of the marketing strategy and optics for the app, the app will present itself as market place for all people and ideas where conversation and arguments occur to reach the best solutions on current news.",rsko9m
App for Gout & Kidney stone foods,1,"I’ll try to give a short and sweet summary as I have questions that people may have solutions to. Any and all feedback appreciated.

I currently have gout & previously had kidney stones. Biggest change that immediately occurs is diet & water intake. 

A large amount of misinformation and confusing data, one website says eating x is okay when you’ve had stones or gout, the second link will say the complete opposite. 

The more direct information (for my type of stones etc & gout) is to eat foods that do not raise uric acid levels (this is caused by purines) 

I’d like to be able to scan the barcodes of food, or just search (because a family friends dinner won’t have a barcode) something along the lines of my fitness pal, the problem from research that I’ve found is that the data required isn’t included in a large amount of foods in the barcode data.

I’ve searched for databases with APIs trying to find this information but no luck so far.

- What are other means possible for attaining this information? 
- is there possibly other metrics that can be used to measure if a food or drink is suitable for a users condition?
- Huge milestone but is there a possibility to have it reviewed by health organisations to gain some form of accreditation for accuracy or approval?",rshsa3
The Upward Rise of Fintech App Market,0,"

Digital transformation has impacted every aspect of the modern-day business world and the story of the financial sector is no different. Thus, as a startup, if you have an idea of developing a fintech app, there is no better time than getting underway right now. Consumers are adopting fintech apps at a rapid rate and traditional players like banks and money lenders are also embracing the rise of the fintech realm.

According to a study conducted by Valuets Reports, the global fintech market is expected to reach a whopping number of $124.3 billion by 2025. Moreover, the rise of this market will be powered by new age technologies such as Python, AI, blockchain, cryptography, distributed computing, etc.",rrvwa0
New music app for collaborative or fun fans—artists,1,"An app that is collaborative, in the sense of upload of music— a different platform aimed at engaging with viewers or collaborative ones, moreso groups n a chat aimed at assisting fans or artist group hopefully together on sharing remixes new lines different beats n collaborative in grand ways easily like your swiping on bands like tinder peak new songs come in with a fresh line or a similar song/beat and perhaps focusing on YouTube since collaborative brings music videos or remix capabilities adds more for the artist and a great growing sense for the fans. so it’d be focused on creation there could be pools or groups of people like a chat for social or lyrics and don’t think about pay when it can be endorsed or sponsored! that can pay well and used as a group lottery amongst artist and collaborators. with collaborative ness and a vast genre or arrray of topics on songs it could have its own twitch channel for artist while Covid is still apparent for some you kinda get what I’m getting at? I’ve ran through it in my head I think if you make a song special for one it could be special for many or learn something that you’d include in another special song, but this could be better for an artist in a switch of genre hopefully have all the artists music stream able or at least a link",rqqhmk

Custom desk idea,1,"So let me start by saying I have no idea if something like this already exists. I’ve never invented anything before and would love to get some help, maybe some partners involved. But here’s my idea:

As someone who loves to play video games, I spend a ton of time sitting at a desk. A few issues I’ve run into with every desk I’ve ever owned:

1. What you buy is what you get. If you want to add something, you need to buy a new desk.

2. If a part breaks, you need to get a whole new desk.

3. Lack of customization. Most desks are cookie cutter designs. I imagine it would cost extra money to have a desk designed perfectly for your space.

My solution: (No name for idea yet)

Imagine the outer frame of the desk is metal bars, with slots running all the way down on every face (just outer frame, the desk can still have a wood desk top). Now these slots are key, I’d like to design them in a way that I can patent it the design. But basically the slots will allow you to buy different parts and pieces to completely customize your desk over time. Every part would have a side with inserts that fit into the slots (think similar to legos). Want to add a shelf? Buy the parts and just snap them together. Want an insert to add a slidable monitor mount? Buy the parts and snap them on. Part of the desk breaks? Just replace the broken parts. The possibilities could be endless.

I probably did a terrible job explaining it but I hope I got the point across. I have more to add to the idea, but this post is already getting very long. So feel free to reach out! But I’d love to hear everyone’s input!",rv7klb
Polarized TV for watching/gaming different things simultaneously.,1,"Not even sure this is possible to do simultaneously, but similar concept as polarized computer screens people use to keep what they working on/looking at private in public, which only they can see if wearing the right glasses. If you can do that while also playing media that can be seen by others, why not make a TV with this capability so that people with different tastes/interests can stay in the same room, with headphone capability for the 2nd audio channel? Want to play violent video games or watch something more interesting while your toddler watches wholesome or educational programing?  Do you and your family members want to spend some time with each other but have very different ideas of entertainment. This way you can watch both, and everyone’s happy.

At home leaf incinerator/water filter concept.,1,"Hi, my Midwestern residence has several 60+ year old oak trees on the property. They tower over the neighborhood and are so majestic and beautiful. However, when it's fall I spend DAYS managing the ever falling leaves. It's the bane of my existence. There are too many to mow up. Too many to haul away. Literally buried up to our tits in leaves.

So I've tried several different ways of managing them. The city dump in my town charges ridiculous rates to take them. All garbage pickup companies have to change their rates to make a profit. Pretty sure they just incinerate them anyways. Right?

So here's my idea. At home incineration. I have seen designs for smokeless barrels. I understand they are usually illegal. (Will cross that bridge when we get to it.) My IDEA is to build a better incinerator. One that somehow manages the extreme heat, leaves, waste, smoke in a safe way. Probably a big ask. But then I remembered something. BONGS AND BONG TECHNOLOGY. Can an incinerator be designed that somehow filters the leaf smoke through a water tank/reservoir? I imagine something like that giant gravity bong that Seth Rogan has. I just don't know enough about bongs. Is it still considered smoke that comes out the other end? Or is it more of a vapor.

Here's my other question. It gets cold AF in my Midwestern town. Specifically in my garage/shop. I have electric heaters and propane space heaters. Yet EVERY fall I am paying and managing massive amounts of leaves. AKA FUEL! Wish I could just save all the damn leaves somehow and convert them into heat in the winter. 2 birds with one stone. idk. Convert them into pellets somehow? 

TLDR: CAN WATER PIPE TECH BE EMBIGGINED TO HELP ME INCINERATE ALL THE LEAVES IN MY YARD. 

TLDR 2: CAN LEAVES BE STORED AND BURNED FOR HEAT IN THE WINTER EFFICIENTLY?

Thanks for your help and consideration. Let's discuss.",rv4nr8

Telepathy device,2,"We have technology already that can see what someone is thinking. That can interpret what someone is saying. The technology we have must be right on the head because our brainwaves are weak.

What if you put a small device on the head, that interprets what the brain is saying, that then transmits those waves in the form of radio waves, that transmits them to someone's receiver on someone's else's head that then uses another process to transmit the image or words into someone's mind? 

If we have the technology that can decode what the brain is saying, we should be able to have technology to send information back into the brain. 

You could also take a step back, and just use the device to transmit sound waves for people to hear, or radio/wifi waves to be picked up on devices like phones for people that can't talk or move. Or you could transmit short short wifi waves for close communication or other radio waves to talk to people farther away to which a device, perhaps utilizing an app, will interpret those signals. I could see someone who cannot talk or move to be able to talk to their family easily in the house, or be able to talk to their family a long way away just thinking about it.

You could also just do a slight surgery that connects the device to the brain as well if it was needed. Additionally, you would be able to control some electronic devices, and hear what's around you in radio waves by tuning your telepathy device.",rs64d7

2. MagicFox - Create your own interactive storybook online powered by GPT-3. Describe your story in a few sentences and see it unfold automatically.
3. A chrome extension that will read your content and analyze it based on keywords to find out if you're using them right in a post and suggest new ones.
4. TodoBeater - To-do chrome extension with a timer, but that's not all. TodoBeater is a time management app that allows you to set your priorities and schedule your day in the most efficient way possible. You can even add timers to each task and get reminded in-browser when it's time to move on.
5. A new type of mobile app for exploring new places with their urban legends, rumors, ghosts stories, and true facts about the area. You can explore by location or search for any specific place or story of your interest.

My favorite from these is definitely #5, but the most potential I think #1 has, especially if someone can target people in long-distance relationships.

"After 1000+ convos with redditors giving me feedback on my free ""look up any company's suppliers"" tool, ImportYeti, I'm happy to announce ImportYeti Beta V4.0",38,"You can find the tool here: [ImportYeti.com](https://www.importyeti.com/)

ImportYeti is a free tool that allows you to search 70,000,000 bill of ladings to answer questions for pretty much any company you can imagine like:

* **Who makes Bass Pro Shop's 4 Burner Gas Griddle?** Answer: Ningbo Huige Outdoor Products
* I thinking of buying barbells from Nantong Leeton Fitness Co., the #1 ranking company on Alibaba for the term ""barbell"". **Is Nantong Leeton Fitness Co. the right supplier for barbells?** Answer: No. They are a big company but primarily sell resistance bands. Thus, they likely outsource their heavy metal work creating a more costly and potentially worse product.
* **Who are the top companies & suppliers who import/export under HS Code 42.02.92 -- trunks & suitcases?**

I created ImportYeti because these bill of ladings are public information and nearly everybody in overseas importing supply chain positions I know uses expensive alternatives to ImportYeti.

Understanding the right factories to choose in your supply chain, can decrease a ton of headaches. It would be my hope that people don't use this to ""copy"" competitor products. There are already enough product clones floating around the internet. Rather, I'd love to help people understand which factories to use versus just blasting out e-mails on Alibaba, trying to intelligently decide which factories to visit, walking into a trade show blind or relying solely on connections with your existing factories.

**I'd love any and all feedback (love or hate)... no matter how brutal, small or crazy : )** I only want to create things that people really love.

"To compete with Multiversus and Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl as Smash competitors, Disney should make its own ""Smash clone""",0,"Ideally this would just be classic Disney characters as Marvel has Marvel Vs. Capcom and Star Wars has Star Wars: Hunters. And yes there are characters in Disney movies that I think would suit a fighting game that aren't just ""animals being heavies a la Donkey Kong"" (though of the animals I can think of multiple Jungle Book characters that'd work) e.g. Merida and Mulan are obvious roster includes, I've been saying Elsa would suit Smash (and therefore would suit a Smash-alike) since Fighters Pass 2 came out, and even the newest movie Encanto could have some reps despite the heroine's lack of powers as Luisa and Isabela have fighting-game-worthy Gifts (the former would be your typical ""heavy"" fighter (I don't think any Smash-esque game has ever really had a female heavy so that'd be breaking new ground) while the latter would be more of a Zelda-esque character like Elsa would be). And that's just the movies as while it'd be too weird to have someone from the live-action shows there's plenty of potential fighters from the cartoons like Luz from The Owl House (each of her specials etc. could be taken from a different coven's discipline of magic) or Phineas from Phineas And Ferb (who'd be a ""gimmick fighter"" like Villager/Isabelle) or less recent characters like Kim and Shego from Kim Possible or the eponymous American Dragon: Jake Long.

And a ""Disney Smash"" would also lend itself to some really cool stage locations like Ahtohallan or the Beast's castle or some sort of multiple-phase Mulan thing where you're fighting everywhere from the mountains (perhaps with an avalanche hazard) to the rooftops and just imagine the music (sure some of it might be kinda inappropriate for a fighting game even if it's all instrumental but how would fighting to something like Part Of Your World be any less jarring than the more mellow Smash tracks like Brewster's Roost or Swan Lesson). And new fighters coming from new movies or shows would be announced with the thing while new post-launch ones from old properties would be announced like a Smash one would be.

Now the question is, would multiverse shenanigans require Sora to be playable in this too with his Smash moveset (or as close as it'd translate with a potentially different setup) and what would that mean for both multiverses' future connections? ;)",ru526a

Multiple player matching irl. More explanation in post.,1,"(Edit. I mean multiplayer irl 😅) I'm not great with explanation but bare with me....

The only problem I could think of as privacy/duplicate profiles but that's what the main company is for. You sign up to the main company with your real info and then use an alias/username at the sub company's. If that makes sense....?

It could be used for making friends, dating or whatever. You could pick a certain age and gender to vs or pair with. At the end of the game you get a survey with options to rate another player and if you want to play with them again or share your info or whatever. Everyone would have gaming profiles.

Holiday Shutdown,1,"I can’t take complete credit for this idea but years ago my ex and I were discussing ways to make the holiday season more of a breeze.

Now before y’all come for me, I understand there are essential businesses that have to be open. I know soldiers, officers, doctors etc. can’t just take off for two weeks. I also think two weeks may be too much time, but I’m proposing this because Christmas and New Years week are the time of the year that people want to work the least.

Folks go on vacations, travel and call out in droves. People are forced to return to work when they really don’t want to which causes  poor morale and work ethic. If you give most people at least the week of Christmas off, I guarantee you wouldn’t deal with as much issues with call outs and no shows.

For government sponsored loans, the government forgives the interest they have charged you on those loans for the life. So if you paid 50k in interest over the past 10 years, that's what you get. If you just got out of school in 2020 and basically have had no pain or interest paid, you get nothing. 

No free hand out. Just giving us back the money that they took from us ( for me it's 6-7% interest for the past 6 years.). Give me my check biden!!",rojoyg
Idea to make a new Kowloon city,16,"So, my plan is to have a person buy about 100 acres of land and then invite anyone and everyone to come and build and live in hopefully leading to a city closely resembling Kowloon walled city before it was demolished in 1993. The total 100 acres would be mostly used for a solar farm to power the city the city itself would only take up around 10 acres comprised of around 1000 buildings if we go of the Kowloon city blueprint. Housing a max population of 500000 people considering that we could build higher than 14 stories the restriction Kowloon had due to its proximity to an airport. The area that I think would be best to build this city is northeast Texas due to its central location and land availability. Water could be collected off of the sloped surfaces of the solar panels allowing for a total collection of 200 Millon gallons per year assuming there are 28 solar panels per acre and each one is 4000ft² and the average rainfall is 34 inches. All the water could be stored underground and on top of buildings as instead of a water tower. With each building likely costing around 10 million that is 10 billion dollars and the solar panels costings 45 million and 1 billion for infrastructure the total comes out to be 11045 million just to build. However, if each person of the assumed half million population pays 22090 dollars, then it will all be paid for all you would have to do is move in.",rogek9

A story set in a world filled with stereotypical fantasy and RPG tropes that explores realistic consequences and reactions involving these tropes.,4,"I first came up with this idea when I was absolutely hammered with my friends and some of their parents. My friends mom and I came up with the general idea, because I hated the fucking hobbit movies so much for what they did to my favorite book of all time. Obviously looking back on it this isn’t even really true, but I said that a goofy “the office” style documentary would have better captured the lighthearted adventure of the book (even now I think it would have been better than what they did with it). But we had a laugh and kinda talked about how it would be funny to see the dwarves sitting there being interviewed and grumbling about the shitty food and goblins and whatever else. 

So since then I’ve always had this little inkling of an idea of a bunch of stories set in a fantasy world, but where it really tries to emphasize how normalized all of the ridiculous fantasy shit is. I’m thinking of things like how some ‘adventurers’ become insanely rich and even affect the politics of major kingdoms and states like in most fantasy settings but then bringing in the perspective of more mediocre adventurers and how it isn’t so glorious and kinda sucks and they struggle to get by dealing with relatively minor problems like the occasional weak magical monster. Maybe something about a group of average soldiers and the issues they have with coming face to face with horrible monsters and legendary warriors that have god-like speed and strength. A merchant who has to deal with magic being an ever present issue and trying to avoid getting scammed by wizards. Stuff like that. 

I don’t know if this has been done before, I’m not really into much contemporary fantasy but I always thought this was a cool idea.",ro4dkq

An app for people to do favors for each other,13,"Not random favors, but kind of like community service for people that genuinely need help. Also like go fund me, except it not specifically money, its more a deed you do to help someone out. You input skills you have, and see posts on your feed from people that need those skills.

Like someone needs to make a commercial for a charity or fundraiser. Someone else with video experience makes them this commercial. This will give the video maker experience, as well as positive reviews and exposure. That's just a random example I thought of, I'm sure there are better examples. I feel like this will bring people closer together, and focus on community and connectiveness.

Now of course, people might abuse this. They might pretend to be desperate for something when they really aren't, just to get a free service. This is something that needs to be worked around.",rzi2e8

DeApps are the trend of next few years,33,"Hey guys, how's it going? Don't you think that things in our world are clearly a bit stale and have stopped progressing? It's not for nothing that there is a phrase in our world, ""Conquest is the engine of progress"" and it seems to me that someone has stopped progressing altogether. If you're wondering who I am, I mean the AppStore and PlayMarket.

These two giants have completely stopped progressing and are just robbing us. Quality is getting worse and cost is getting higher, content is constantly being paid for and so on. I think they don't have long to go and other promising projects will replace them.

Take Magic Square. They are already testing a new type of platform for Magic Store apps. It will be a completely new and unique system for both developers and users. Developers have already got an improved and easier system to launch their products, and we, the users testing the applications can get our bonuses and then, obviously, get a better product.

How do you find a developer/dev company to help make a prototype?,1,"Hey all, 

How does someone with an invention idea go about developing a working prototype without themselves being a tech person? Say the idea were a wearable device that interacts with your computer via bluetooth--how would you go about finding someone to work with on actually getting that idea out of the imagination/sketch phase, and into real engineering and ultimately working form?

Are there companies that are well known for that space that are also trustworthy? What types of protection does one need in order to protect the idea from being stolen? Do such companies usually take up front fees or ask for a % of rights? 

Pretty new to all this and much of the research I am finding online is geared towards getting prototypes made for objects--ie things that can be 3d printed and don't also need to function electronically--or for apps, which are a different thing entirely.

Any good resources as well that people in here rely on? Whether it be books, sites, podcasts, etc?

Hair bruch New generation,1,"please excuse my english if it is not perfect.  it would be a product that would target female customers much better.
 I explain;  Your hair, unfortunately, has a terrible natural tendency to absorb the odors around you and the bacteria in it.  Whether it's while smoking or hanging out with smokers, coming out of a workout, staying in a room that smells too much, or even being out on the street for too long.  You feel the need to remove those odors and unwanted effects that are damaging your hair.  However, you may not have the time or the inclination to start your treatment and wait for it to work.
 This is why we created an innovative solution to enable consumers of cosmetic products to use their hair care more effectively.  We are therefore looking to create a new generation hairbrush, which will have the direct capacity to apply your care.  This brush can receive what are called ""doses"", this variety of doses will be composed of different types of products: exotic perfumes, essential oils, moisturizing lotions ... the consumer can choose the doses of his choice, which correspond to his  current needs, and can insert them inside the brush (where a compartment will be created beforehand).  This is how, while brushing their hair, the recipient can spray the contents of the dose that they have inserted onto their scalp.  To do this, all he has to do is press a button on the handle of this brush and the pressure system will do the rest of the work.
 This brush will offer the ability, at the same time, to perfume your hair with a sweet scent of vanilla while being at work or at school, but it will also allow you to apply specific care much more in depth.
 Transportable, discreet and easy to use, consumers can take care of themselves at any time.",rxs436

This one's for the car guys,0,"I like cars. You like cars. We all like cars. Especially fast and furious ones! I find it unfair that we have to limit ourselves based on the poor driving of normies in their dumb SUVs and faux-luxury sedans. And not to mention so many bullshit regulations on molded cars and imports because of ""Safety""

There is no other community in the world that values safety as much as the motorsport community does! Role cages, helmets, 5 point harnesses, adjusted steering for better handling, bucket seats for safe control, fire extinguishers. Those things are like trophies to us and anyone who has them are seen as gods. So I find it bullshit that I'd get a nice, new r34 spec crushed because it doesn't meet 33 year old safety guidelines, when I can make it safer than 3 year old safety guildines! (I have yet to see a consumer car from factory that already has a roll cage on it. Just sayin)

Now, this is is where my idea comes In for us. I believe we should have a specialized liscence for car enthusiasts and our suped up street cars. This liscence will give access to imports that don't meet certain regulations necause the liscence would prove we are more than responsible and knowledgeable enough to own them. There could be after hours times where speed limits don't apply to people with this liscence between certain hours of the night, I'm certain areas where traffic is damn near non-existent. 

There would be a special test that people who wish to obtain the liscence can take that is much harder than normal (so idiots in lifted Sierras don't get them). There can be an even higher age limit, let's say 21, and more time behind the wheel without infractions or citations (I wouldn't even be old enough to obtain it for another 2 years, so you know I'm serious!). Punishments for road infractions before after hours would be a lot harsher due to the expected responsibility of these special-liscensed drivers. Things like DUIs, Hit and Runs, and other serious offenses would have the liscence revoked for very long periods of time, or even permanently, depending on the offense.

Now, I know what you're thinking: ""how are cops gonna know if you have the liscence? They'd have to pull you over regardless, and that ruins the purpose""
To that, I have a few solutions: maybe put a qr code on the vehicles that speed readers can identify and ignore during after hours. Don't want the sticker? Then leave it to the registration office. Have your liscence plate be the identifier of an after hours vehicle, so if a cop is suspicious, they can tail you, track your plate, and if it clears you, they'll fuck off. Or, even more, After Hours drivers can call their local PD ahead of time to clear themselves and any participants in any rallies, meets, street races, etc. That way, it gives the organizers more personal liability and more of a reason to keep everyone in check and be more responsible.(so you don't have mustangs trying to kill crowds coming out of the lot)

Another concern I can see popping up is the common rebuttal of ""If YoU wAnNa DrIvE fAsT, KeEp iT oN ThE tRaCk""
If you're the kind of person that says this, please stop talking and take your base model Hyundai Sonata elsewhere. Not everyone has access to a dedicated track, and not every track is open or suitable to every driver's tastes. There are backroads that are rarely traveled down, and people may just want a quick 30 seconds down an empty highway where no one is around but themselves. If they crash Into themselves, it's their fault. People want to use an empty parking lot for some quick donuts and what not, so let them, so long as they are impeding traffic and have taken the measures to make sure no one uninvolved is hurt.

That brings me to my next point/ concern. ""What if other people get hurt by these After Hours drivers?"" The drivers will be directed to take every measure possible to ensure no other people are injured by After Hours activities. That means shutting down roads in advance (if allowed by their county/state). That means letting other After Hours drivers if anyone is coming into the general area and could be harmed, which would in turn prompt others to temporarily halt their activities. That means no speeding or swerving on busy roads. This is 9nce again, all driver liability, and measure that proper street racers and car enthusiasts would be MORE than happy to take! There can be different insurance policies that incentivises the drivers to be more cautious and responsible. Different regulations that apply to modded and imported vehicles.

"The Ocean Side of Earth, Rising Oceans, The Future of Earth & Its Inhabitants",1,"Hey,  So I've had a couple ideas come to me and there's no way they are complete or able to come alive by me alone. So if anything here makes sense to you please share these ideas and get something started;  
1. Free Energy, Basic Necessities, Never ending employment for everyone.  
Check out the ocean side view of earth and think about how humans could use this space to create   
 solar / wind  farms,  & harness kinetic energy from the Ocean waves to create; Free energy for all of humanity, agriculture & building material production, housing & distribution of listed things. To get there we could build floating hexagonal pods that are powered the same way, solar/wind/hydro, to get there and stay while its being built, coming back for materials and stock, but also beginning the production of free necessities via those 3 elements and high efficiency technology, even if we have to remain on fossil fuel to a degree until everything is operational.  

This would change us to a type 1 civilization & turn the Continents of Earth to all first world country status.

 This would also in turn generate basic needs for humans to be born into a world with =/= chances.  No single entity would profit from basic needs anymore, or own this unless it's improved on, or they were the person behind its production and completion. It should be funded and created by all of the nations. Every nation builds a massive pod to set sail / turbo float to the back side where we begin operation: ""Let's make free stuff now that we can, Cause why the hell not.""  


2. Divert rising natural water sources (Lakes, Oceans, etc) with a new highway/tunnel system for aquatic vehicles that are land to water and submersible.   


3. Create trumps massive wall only around the Continents as Kinetic energy harvesters that also serve as wave breakers in the event of a single massive event.. Something far out, or multiple things far out, that will dissipate the strength of a tsunami but not disturb the natural flow of water.    


4. Control the run off water of the Ice caps by creating a water collecting system that collects and brings down fresh water for it to be distributed to 2nd and 3rd world countries until they are 1st world. Or just start bringing down glaciers for them.   


5. Harvest heat energy from volcanos by diverting or tapping into their heat sources without altering the natural surroundings. Kinda just dip some metal toe's in there and let the heat rise and utilize the hot rods.   


6. Take Religion out of everything society has its hand in,  as it is a personal belief and concept some people buy into and some people do not, there's also just too many. Keep Religion at home and in the Churches and what not.  I praise the Sun in a way, but you don't see me throwing it down anyone's throat or writing In Solar Systems We Trust on my cheque's.   


7. Build a newer bigger ISS that is also producing things and drops food / materials / batteries down as it flies over countries / states / provinces  / islands etc

9. Ocean plastics recycling facilities that turn plastics into pellets and 3'd print in the Ocean after being sorted from trash.",rygf40

A movie theater ticket auction system,1,"The ticket prices are at the same level pretty much the whole time. It changes probably year to year. But some movies are in way higher demand than others. In this system we have a situation where there's a lot of people who would be willing to pay more to see a movie earlier, and on the other side we have people who would gladly see the movie weeks after the premiere, but the ticket prices are to high for them even in that situation. I have asolution to translate that demand onto the ticket prices.


It works like this: it's an online system where you lock in your debet card, you pick a movie theater seat and you bid how much you're willing to pay for that seat. If you bid the highest at the end of the bidding process, the payment is made and you get the ticket. 


Why lock in your card? To prevent trolls who would sabotage the system by bidding billions of dollars. If you decide to troll anyway by bidding over your balance, the system will give the ticket to the next person in line who has the required balance to pay for the ticket. The bidding could start at a level at which the theater makes a profit, let it be 2/3/5/whatever dollars. You didn't get the ticket at the maximum price you're willing to pay? Later starts the auction for the next hour/day. The bidding price could be public so people can see live how much are people bidding at any given time (the bidders' data would obviously be hidden). 


I'm not Amaerican, I don't know if there's any regulations preventing such system to be implemented, but if there is one, try to analyse my idea regardless of that.

App providing Pet transportation services for pet owner to travel with their pets,1,"Some big cities offer solutions to travel with your pet in a taxi or Uber for instance. However, travelling between cities with pets without owning a car is very difficult. The idea is to allow any pet lover who owns a car to promote their next trip online (carpooling app) with the type of pets they are allowing in their vehicle to share the journey. In other words, it is a carpooling app for pet travel. Of course, this will mean that one pet will be considered as an additional passenger and only one family owning pet(s) will be allowed into the vehicle. Travelling from one city to another is very cumbersome with a pet as it usually involves taxi, bus/train and taxi again with pets hopefully being allowed. The current carpooling apps are not pet focused unfortunately and it is not always easy to find a pet friendly owner. Directing the users to the right pet driver for them according to the pet they own, number of people and where they are going is then a key selling point of the app.",rwx2km
Semi medieval armor sweater,2,"I saw online these cool looking sweaters with a knight's helmet. I bought one and they were terrible quality. The face cover was a thin flappy piece of fabric  held by two small buttons that attached to the hoodie. That is when I got the idea to make this product better by using hard cardboard or plastic and use a fabric sleeve to hold the shape. Then I thought what if I made other sweaters with the same concept but from different media like a sweater that makes you look like some one from dark souls or bat man, etc. I don't know how to make clothes, but i plan on learning the basics this year. If anyone has a better idea on how to make my idea happen let's chat.",rwq7t8
Dumb theory on Evolution,1,"
This is an experimental post and it's okay if you think this is dumb ..but I had a lot of fun thinking about it .😂

Idk if it is already somewhere .. someone could have thought about it ..or even discarded it , so no promises there. 

was just studying and chilling watching shows etc .. and this haunting feeling slowly took shape within me .

Just here to blabber as idk what to do with it .

while reading this  You could be intrigued , curious or to say the least .. entertained  Or you could say m high and find plenty of mistakes ... well i don't care ..you can take it anyway you like. Comments and discussion are welcome.

So here it is.

I always wondered evolution agrees survival of fittest.. but never really clicked with what are we doing with so much of cellular organisms and other beings . Well they do survived ofcourse but a what's the purpose kind ..in general .
(No purpose to life ofcourse😂😂)


In All the structure in evolution .. 
We have trancended dimensions .
( I know it's lot more complex than that ..but haven't thought this through)


Organisms evolved from no sense of environment to 3D perception . That's a fact.

Reading all the biolgy we see..

Organnells good at one task came together and made a functioning cell.


Cells evolved from uni cellular to collaborating with other cells with specific diffrentiated functions.

But before this there might be many prokaryotes and unicelluar organism which just evolved in doing and getting better with just what they have.
But once colonizers started to dominate they were in a different league.

Our body is essentially like a planet with really good interconnections between it's cellular residents who all are assingned to do specific functions . Complete with police force , messaging and control systems.
But None can see or feel what we do as a whole.
That is 3D perception.

Let this sink in for a sec. Cauz the cells may not even be aware of the gravity of perception that is available to us.



Maybe ..just maybe 

We are headed there too.

in a sense there exits multiple cellular planets ..like many animals ..
Like the cells..
It's the same for humans .. and a few others like the Termites , which are so good at colonization that there colonies are actually considered to be SUPERORGANISM ..the basis of this discussion.

For what we know maybe the plant population attempt it in forrests .
Anyways the humans could be doing this by means of technology.

For eg . We don't see the light in its full spectrum.
But we know about it and have utilised it to our advantage.
Through extensions of technology.

By internet and other means ..we are making an interconnected society, or at least headed there.

It could get so good to a point that we eventually function like an ORGANISM.

with existence and perception in literally more dimensions than we could imagine.

From 2D cells to 3D organisms ..what next ..

Or we are just cancer to this already existing organism.😅😅

And this is just one organism .. say an Earth (like a human)
Or any other organisms ( elephant ..dog.. or even . Sun .. mars..etc etc 😂)

It would be cool i knw , and yes it could actually also go in completly different direction and we could be near extinction ofcourse, outdone by our own creation...or even singulairty and stuff .😂

But 
Who cares.😊✌️

I enjoyed this.. may be was fun for u too 😅

App Ideas to get started within 2022,0," Today, there are the number of apps in the app stores and the numbers have been increasing by leaps and bounds. There are new apps developed for various purposes, goals, and objectives making their way into the app market. All this because there is a rising opportunity of going big and becoming the Unicorn entrepreneur or successfully commencing the development plans of their app idea and starting their dream project.

There are plenty of app ideas and unicorn business proposals doing the rounds in the market and many entrepreneurs are in search of a good idea that would give them better profits. On that note,  let’s take a look at some of the excellent app ideas that could make your venture an enterprising one with an opportunity to earn better ROI for years to come.

1. E-learning apps

2. EV Charging location finding app

3. Machine learning assisted car breakdown service

4.  AI-based weather forecast app

5. Astrology app

6.  Startup Assistance App",s236f3
Group Travel App,2,"The idea here is basically an itinerary planner that helps you get on the same page with everyone involved in a trip and has the functionality to help with budgeting the trip, voting on a hotel/airbnb, and planning all the things you would like to do in a given area.

Users can easily vote on their stay at first and then on different events/experiences and on which dates they want to do those events/experiences. Once a stay is agreed on, you can see the driving distance to all the events/experiences in the trip and calculate the cost of gas automatically given the rental car your using and other useful tidbits like that to help calculate some of the hidden costs so that no one is blindsided by unexpected costs.

There are already plenty of trip itinerary apps, but none that I am aware of that help people plan together as a group with things like in-app polls/voting and choosing dates and a budget that works for everyone.

This idea stems from having some very large and disorganized group trips with friends where people weren't aware of the prices of certain things or what the group was doing on what day and this caused problems that could have easily been solved if all the trip info was neatly organized into an app rather than having it thrown around in a group messaging chat.

I'm a full-stack software engineer who is already building this for myself to use with my friends before I release it on the web and app stores so feel free to give any suggestions or feedback.",s1x9a1

If you allow voice chat then you get to see the complete profile of the person and you can connect with that person permanently and share all forms of media.

A Social App for business people to share their stories,3,"Today, many people are starting their own business. Not matter what type of business they do, which countries they are in, how big or small their business is.  
The idea is to share story of entrepreneurs so that other starting or small business people can learn from it. And collecting news + interviews to one single app to learn others.  
Perhaps you can chat with verified successful entrepreneurs to get some advices.

  
The app name will be ""Empower"" and it is the only social app for business people, advisors, entrepreneurs, young & motivated people who are starting their own business.",s108jt
DeAppStore is near ahead,32,"The difficulty with Satoshi Nakomoto's anonymity (or, according to many, its greatest value) is that it propelled decentralization to the forefront of public consciousness. Since then, crypto businesses, applications, NFTs, and even crypto games have had to demonstrate or promise complete decentralization in order to be accepted by the crypto community.

Decentralization has evolved into a pseudo-religion. People evaluate items based on their degree of decentralization, and anything with a smidgeon of centralization is discarded. But this preoccupation isn't grounded in reality.  
In truth, not all blockchain applications are made equal, and certain data does not need to be saved on the blockchain. Some pieces of information necessitate more privacy and censorship resistance, whereas others do not. A monetary transaction is likely to be recorded and preserved on-chain, but the design for a crypto game is likely to be hosted on a central server.

Despite the fragmented nature of decentralization, one approach is to establish a second layer to fulfill the demands of the user and offer a unified experience. Magic Square is accomplishing this by offering the first crypto app store, which is a centralized location for consumers to find, utilize, and connect with the crypto community.  
Many layer2 solutions are highly centralized to provide the level of experience users are looking for. But Magic Square has created a unique solution that provides a highly decentralized layer2 buffer for cryptocurrency-based applications. Magic Square achieves this by powering the platform with a community of validators. Almost all Magic Square decisions are decided by the community which makes the platform especially attractive for the decentralized community.",s0kp51
I need some feedback on a Life organising app,5,"Hi everyone! I need some feedback on an idea i have had for some time...

There are a lot of apps out in there that will help you organise some aspect of your life, for example: todo's, shopping lists, fridge/pantry organizer, habit trackers, birthday calendar, workout trackers .... but these are all individual apps.Almost none of them have an open API that would let you integrate all this data in one single dashboard/app.My idea is to make an app that would let your track/organise all aspects of your life...basically it's a combination of all useful apps out there combined into one. But with a major advantage, the various modules would be linked to each other.

So for example you could have a ""Household"" module where you define a bathroom that needs cleaning ever x days (or you can set it do dirty as needed :) ) ... this cleaning task would automatically become an entry in the ToDo module, where it can be assigned to someone in the household.Once the ToDo task is done, the bathroom cleaning would automatically be reset in the Household module.

Another example could be about the fridge/pantry module and the amount left of a produce... this could be automatically be suggested in the shopping list. Once the item is  ticked off the shopping list, the ""Amount available"" in the pantry module would be reset to ""Full"". Based on the available produce in the pantry... a recipe could be suggested.

What do you guys think? Would this be useful?What ""modules"" would you want  to see  in such an app and how would you use the data that is inputted?

Thanks for the help!",s05ixc

Modular Battery Idea for Electric Vehicles to Power Equipment,5,"I guess the best way to think about this is a Hershey Chocolate bar---break off a piece for the energy needed in the moment for whatever is needed in the moment.  Imagine an all electric lawn mowing service which might need to power four or five devices.  If the range of the truck was, say, 200 miles, that's probably a lot further than it's going to travel in a day.  If the battery to the vehicle were modular in the way I'm imagining, it could power the electric lawn mower, hedge trimmer, weed eater, leaf blower, etc.  And on days off, that power would be available to power the vehicle.  Of course, that power could be used to power endless number of useful electric things.  Thoughts?",s2o79x
my 'Shower Thought' ... (drying after a)Shower idea:,4,"Hi!

I remember when I started to daydream about this concept- I was about 12 years old(32 now) and I remember getting the idea after my mom took our car at the time through a typical automated car wash, I always liked the drying part at the end of the car wash, with the fighter jet nozzle tip looking dryers from the top and both sides of the vehicle blasting hot air down on the vehicle!

Anyways, I've always, from time to time(usually when drying myself off after a shower with a towel) thought of how great an adapted version of the car wash drying system would be inside of our shower areas.

I am born/raised/living in Hawaii, which means I know just how shitty humidity is on a daily basis. 'Sweating' after a shower is not uncommon, and no I don't have Hyperhidrosis! 

I think towels just suck at drying us off after a shower. I also don't think it's a very hygienic method that we all use on the daily to dry our entire bodies off after a bath/shower. It just seems so archaic/antiquated... why haven't we transcended this thousand-year-old method?

Well, because it's probably very hard. Especially with my car wash dryer converted for shower use idea... lol. But I do think if made a possiblity, it would certainly directly translate into better person hygiene, less moisture in your bathroom which means less microbial/mold growth attraction, even if minuscule will definitely add up over time!

Plus, just think of how much less electricity you'd use now that you basically would never have to run a laundry load of your shower towels however often you are doing now. Less carbon footprint/less electricity use will depend heavily on carwash-jet nozzle dryer invention for shower thingy and its ability to pump out high velocity winds in every orifice of ours, while also using less electricity than households currently do, on average, for putting our shower towels through our washing machines and dryers(I understand that some of you lucky folk out there can hang your towels/laundry on a clothes line after you wash it... sadly my subdivision outright bans clotheslines because it makes the area look too poors apparently :( it seems to be a common HOA rule now amongst other/newer subdivisions here as well... not sure if this is prevalent in other states or not though?

Alas, I have basically no mechanical/engineering background. I also don't have the 'architect' type headspace that some lucky folk out there seem to have! Lol.

Anyways, I'll stop here I suppose. Has anyone else ever thought about this 'problem' of using towels and a similar, meaningful, and better way might be possible?",s1ykcq

Music therapy massage pill,6,"A handheld battery operated device that produces stimulating and soothing massaging vibrations.  The vibrations will be in different rhythmic patterns, but can also be synced to music. I want to produce music that works with the technology for the device to make it actually something amazing, and effective. In addition, The device could be used to vibrate in sync with any other song the user selects via Bluetooth.  It could be paired via Bluetooth with a speaker synced up to the vibration.  There’s other implications as well but I could explain it could be used in the technology.  The technology, simplified, would  combine speaker and subwoofer technology with electronic massage technology, vibrational device technology, as well as battery technology, since it would most likely have to Have a powerful but small battery to work well.  Could be corded if necessary, but ideally cordless. I am skilled musician of 25 years with full recording technology, and I have a Bachelors Degree in Psychology from CSU.  I would like to work with someone that understands technology of speakers, Especially Bluetooth speakers, and their manufacturing, as well as vibrational device technology. After the design and prototype is made, I would would do market research and try to gain clout to get investors.

I realize that Ill need to hire a team to help me design the product as well, which I’m hoping to find or get suggestions for here on Reddit.  I have several more invention ideas, some still yet to be posted, that Me as well as my friends think would be very marketable, practical, and profitable.

How about using our Social media platforms as NFT-platforms,1,"People are very active on Social media and Reddit is one of the best ones. 

Reddit in-fact has very useful properties and I see lot of potential using it for ""new"" system that I could call: ""Social Ownership Platform"". 

People could get their names marked as owners of certain photo and the ownership is visible to other people as exclusive post flairs.

The idea of owning something is one of the key aspects of why people are interested in NFTs. 

""then it can't be seen in opensea"". Yes, you are right but how about creating reddit's own one?

How about creating lots of in-reddit NFT-subs?

""bUT it needs work and you could get scammed etc""
Everything you do needs work and of course only the best ones could make it to the top just how it goes with real subreddits such as r/NFT.

I think I found a way that Green Goblin's glider may be possible (kind of),12,"Hoverbikes have one main reason why they are not practical: the power source required to sustain flight for any decent length of time is almost always too heavy.

Solution: tether a rollable battery pack to roll with you on the ground while you fly. It's not a perfect solution, but it would make it at least kind of possible for lengthened flights.

What if the cable gets snagged? Maybe there can be a quick disconnect if too much tension is detected, and there could be \*just\* enough battery on-board the hover-vehicle to lower you down to safety.

The battery pack wouldn't be pulled by the hover vehicle. It could have its own drive system to take the load off of it, and it could even be driven **in front** of the hover vehicle. 

I know this kind of defeats the point of being able to hover over all-terrain but think of it as more of a fun hobby-like thing to ride in an open field rather than an actual commuter vehicle.

Vertical lift is power inefficient, and powering a rolling battery takes a lot less power than pulling the weight of the battery upwards. It's transferring vertical force to horizantal.

Note: I know those water jetpack things exist, I'm talking about for land.",s57bhr

Letter to Y Combinator

Everyone leaps on a great idea like a life preserver. But me.

Accomplishments:

Conquered schizophrenia without medication, 8 years human intelligence in army, 1 year counterintelligence support at US consulate, created skyjuke app for iOS and Android, survived homelessness and psychosis, possess proof that I am the most creative person ever, indigenous 

First of all, I am a genius. I didn’t go to Harvard, I went to the battlefield. I am not some 20 something that has a coding language and a stolen idea. I am the wielder of imagination. I do not require python, I require elegance.

Genius comes at a price and I have paid it. In our culture, we worship the prodigy instead of perseverance. I aim to change that. I aim to show our people how experience from struggle hones oneself. I aim to show people how an extraordinary life leads to extraordinary ideas, instead of genetics and quality of schooling.

All entrepreneurs develop their business plans on their sweet time. I have developed something that comes at a price unlike them. After failure and insanity, I have developed a plan for THE TAKEOVER. I don’t need you at all. I already possess something you nerds could never calculate. An imagination that surpasses all. Possessing such power, all I desire is to share it and enrich everyone.

I am a master of story logic (fuck coding). This is pertinent because I can destroy anyone at VR.

Why Naming-as-a-service is an incredible niche hidden in plain sight,25,"Hey everyone! 

I post regularly about business ideas and opportunities. I've made previous posts like this and you all seemed to like it. You can check out more ideas like this [here](http://opportunities.so).

## **Names-as-a-Service**

**Background**

- [Here's the link](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/21/beau-jessup-teen-pays-college-fees-by-naming-chinese-babies.html) to an incredible article. The short version is that a British teenager runs [Special Name](http://www.specialname.cn/), a website designed to provide Chinese parents with culturally appropriate English names for their babies. At first she offered the service for free but nows she's charging 79 cents per name and so far was able to earn more than $400k.
- I also recently noticed that [Starter Story](https://www.starterstory.com/) gets most of its traffic from posts covering naming ideas. Almost 30% of the top keywords it ranks for contain the word ""name"". Just a few examples: ""boutique name ideas"", ""photography business names"", ""kids clothing brand names"", ""good youtube channel names"", ""podcast name ideas list"", ""clothing store name ideas"", ""candle name ideas"", ""bicycle company names"", ""unique bakery names"". There are hundreds of similar keywords that drive significant traffic to Starter Story.[Pro subscribers](https://opportunities.so/pro/) can access a comprehensive, enriched list of keywords Starter Story ranks for organically [here](https://opportunities.so/pro-resources/).(As an aside, I recently signed up for the Starter Story Premium Plus plan and was really disappointed. The focus is clearly on quantity over quality. Most of the content is written for the Google crawler, not for humans. For example, this is how they explain the business idea to ""[Start an API](https://www.starterstory.com/ideas/api)"": ""*Often times, as a API, you typically work alone and do not have much face-to-face interaction with other team members.*"" In other words, it's automatically generated garbage.)

- Baby names for Chinese parents is just one example. What other countries and languages could this model be applied to?
- If you search for terms like ""boutique name ideas"" all of the top results are simply static lists of names. Not a particularly good solution imho but it's clearly working. Using [GPT-3](https://openai.com/) it's very easy to churn out lists as Starter Story does.
- Slightly better are naming tools like [Namelix](https://namelix.com/). However, since they make their profit through affiliate commissions from premium domain sales the incentives are not really aligned. The name ideas tools like Namelix generate are usually low-quality since this pushes people towards the premium names they also list. Moreover, the names are usually not dynamically generated but simply pulled from a large database. (ML models are expensive to host and run.)
- Next we have on-demand services like Special Name which involve some human touch. You can use tools like GPT-3 to generate a long list of ideas for each client but then curate it manually to make sure they're really relevant. (I recently explored this model very successfully with [Product Ideas](http://productideas.co/). I own the domain BrandNames.ai and hence I might try to apply the same model to the naming niche.)
- Given that names are extremely important for parents or business owners I bet at least some of them would be willing to pay $50+ for a premium consultation with a naming expert.
- Now the absolutely best solution would be to tie all of these levels together. Churn out static lists at scale to attract visitors from Google. Then sell them your naming services or tools.

"Reboot The Listserve, an email lottery where one person every day can email everybody in the mailing list if they win",5,"Today I found out that [The Listserve](http://thelistserve.com/) has ended and that’s such a shame, because I used to get a lot of interesting emails from all across the world and I would fantasize on what I would email to thousands of people when given the chance. Someone should reboot a version of it. 

About the Listserve: 

The  Listserve is a massive e-mail list -- a 'listserv.' 


Each day, one person is randomly selected to write one e-mail to the growing list. That's the only e-mail allowed to be sent to The Listserve.


(And the winner's e-mail address won't be disclosed to the listserv -- unless they want it to be.)

Such a simple idea, and yet so powerful!",s2h0zn
An app that is used to personally send files like chat attachments,29,"The amount of files needed to be shared with people is growing. Sometimes there is only one person that needs a file. This app would generate id for the device and you could share it with your friend in need. Then initiate file sending and your friend would accept it first checking that the file being sent is correct. File would be shared directly between devices without server involvement after successful connection. Server would only make these devices find eachother.

I am aware of cloud services but they have only limited storage and there is always the bother of sending the file to the cloud and sharing links and managing rights. This would allow sharing files like orphan attachments and without size limit. I am also aware of torrents but they are not as easy to understand like select and click to share-to-your-contact type.

Connection would obviously be secure with strong encryption between devices. The recipient of the file or files could individually choose where to put the files.

Pros:

* Would not need to buy a cloud service for large files.
* Only storage size is the limit for file sizes.
* No middle men to touch your security.
* Easy to share whatever you need to share with who ever you need to share.
* Personal sharing.
* Full control what to share. Select and share. Know who is in the other end.
* Can secure connection offline (share encryption keys face to face with trusted peer).

Is this a good idea? And if there is such an app please do share the knowledge as I haven't found it. Signal would work otherwise but **a)** It disallows large files and **b)** It does not ask consent from the recipient if he would like to receive said file(s). Having consent for large files is important as they greatly take space on his device.

Not like the others: Nikocado Avocado,0,"Hello, I am a 14 year old with an idea. This idea is not like the others on this subreddit though. I was watching oompaville (O) on YouTube when I stumbled across one of his Nikocado Avocado (NA) videos. O kept on saying things like how he can turn his life around, and that made me remember about everyone just saying how much he has screwed up, but he can still fix it. NA even started to like the idea of gain weight. So I got and idea: what if instead of telling him how bad it is, why don't we show him. Someone starts doing mukbang videos just like him and gains rapid weight. They keep on saying that NA is their inspiration, which will hopefully make NA finally realize how bad what he is doing is. That person making NA realize puts on fake weight to stay perfectly healthy. I know that this will most likely die in new, but I really think that this may work. If you see this, send it to people so we can fix this.

P.S. Don't let NA see this.

A community that connects menders/repairers/tinkerers with broken consumer goods that would otherwise be not utilized or thrown out.,65,"It would be a non profit, although I don’t think it would even need to be classified as such, since it would probably just be a Facebook group or an app at best.

Initially, it would service a couple neighbouring neighbourhoods in our city, if the model works we could open it to the entire city.

An individual will post (a Facebook post) their broken item and either offer them up for free or ask for repair - 

haven’t thought if they should put a cost on their repair or ask for free repair - what do you think? I like the idea of it being a free community… but I could see that having some benefits of ask for repair work feature - getting the item into a useable state, employing. I do foresee some problems with undervaluing work, damage liability, etc. 

In addition the menders/repairers/tinkerers could make a request for broken items. 

We have a local BuyNothing group. If you’re not familiar with BuyNothing it is described as “BuyNothing offers people a way to give and receive, share, lend, and express gratitude through a worldwide gift economy network” BuyNothing is great! but I rarely see broken items, or less than perfect items being gifted through Buy Nothing. I also think that while BuyNothing is best as a hyper local group, this repair group would need a larger member amount because repairers (for lack of a better word, maybe menders?) people are not concentrated in one area. 

The idea arises from seeing large amounts of consumer waste on garbage day, what if some of that could be diverted?

Name of the group could be Mend Something, Fix Something, Fix Anything, Fix Everything, Fix-it-all, Repair Something, Busted, Reepair, Menders … I’m open to more suggestions

Also the city name of neighbourhood name would come after it.

Smart Meal Planning App,4,"Not a dev or entrepreneur; just had an idea. I don't know if this exists or not already.

The meat and potatoes of the app would be the ability to input your own recipes/meals into the app. Want to add mom's eggplant parmesan? Just make a 'card' for it. A card would be the ingredients and instructions. The feature of the app that makes it a meal planning app would be the ability to schedule meals in advance for however far into the future (max a month maybe) and how many meals you would like to make. The meals would be randomized and you can set how often you would like meals to repeat (though there would be some limitations if you have few recipes - think the shuffle feature on music streaming apps). Another feature of the app is the grocery list; the app would make a list of all the ingredients in the correct amounts you need to make the meals for that week/month (would depend on how often you go grocery shopping). Finally, when it's time to cook, you can go to the meal's recipe card and read the instructions.

Let me know what y'all think!",s8cn97

I made a website (soon to be app) that functions in a similar way as the old StumbleUpon. How can I make it more awesome?,8,"I'm not ready to launch, so I won't say what it's called yet (plus, I don't want to violate any self-promotion rules, even though it's still in development). But basically, the current functionality is push button --> random website from a personally curated list of destinations (3000+ and counting). It's an assortment of fun/interesting websites, as well as videos (documentaries, music videos, upcoming movie trailers, random YT videos I like), music (mostly sourced from SoundCloud and Spotify, but will probably add other sources), and images (infographics, wallpapers, artsy stuff).

That's the nutshell version. It's currently all being randomly pulled from the same bucket, so to speak, and anything that's a video or music track appears as an embedded player from the source (i.e. YouTube player, SoundCloud player, Spotify playlist widget, etc).

Basic features I'm working on (in order of priority):

1) Membership option - free registration and all that. Perks will be that you can bookmark your favorite discoveries, filter ""interests"" from the random pool (include/omit certain types of sites), and I guess make a basic profile page.

2) Add a way to separately randomize videos, music, and everything else, so that you can potentially listen to a discovered music track or have a floating video player while browsing websites (not too sure aesthetically what would be best here yet).

3) Piggybacking off of the first feature, I want to implement a social element to all of this, so you can make friends and combine interest pools or ""send"" discoveries to each other. Also, you can see how many other users favorited a website, or if any of your friends already did. Still thinking of the logistics of this, but I like the idea

4) Eventually, I'd like to do a submission system, but that's a ways away. Maybe there can be a credit system or something (like karma here, for example) based on how often a user uses the site, and when you reach a certain point, you're trustworthy enough to submit (I'd obviously have to review the submission)

So, there you have it. This is all for fun (as well as a crash course on coding for me), but I want to make it as great as possible. No paid ads, if I can avoid it.

All of this in mind I have a couple of questions to the community:

1) What would you like to see from a project like this? If you've ever used a tool like StumbleUpon, Mix, etc...were there any wishlist features you would have liked, and what were the annoyances and/or features you didn't care for?

2) More on the technical side... Does anyone know of an efficient way to mass-categorize websites, based on interest categories (I'd rather not personally go one-by-one and categorize them myself)? I've considered trying to web scrape with Google meta data, but this info isn't available for everything.

Thanks for reading, and thanks for any suggestions/tips. This has been a lot of fun to develop so far.",s7txp0
Advanced programmable email filter,1,"*Forgive me if this already exists.*

I would totally pay a monthly subscription for a service which used IMAP to intercept my email before it came to me and performed a series of programmable functions to filter unwanted messages.

Some examples of programmable functions could be:

* If there's an unsubscribe link, automatically visit the link and then move the email to junk, then auto block this domain forever.  I realize that not everyone would want this so it should be a toggled option. Or perhaps a configured option like: block for (\_period\_of\_time\_) unless (\_message\_contains\_password\_reset\_link\_) and (\_content\_from\_list\_you've\_made\_).
* I get loads scam emails everyday from hastily set up gmail accounts like: advancedserviceforyou-at-gmail-dot-com.  I would love it if I could auto-block all traffic from a gmail addresses, unless I've sent an email to one specific gmail address previously.
* Continuing with the scam emails: I get a lot of emails from 'businesses' who have purchased a goDaddy domain name and installed the most basic email-in-a-box software and are sending me scam emails.  When you visit the domain name there's no forward facing website just the standard boilerplate for goDaddy domains which are using the default DNS records.  I would love a function which visits the domain name and checks to see if there's some actual content like images, non-lorem-ipsum text and a minimum word count(maybe 200). All of these could be toggles since not everyone would want to perform these checks.
   * Building on this, it could also be a good idea to scan the DNS records and make sure they have at least one non-standard A record, and or CNAME record.  If they're using the default NameCheap, GoDaddy, or other domain host's default dns settings then the email would get filtered.
* 'Content quality'.  Exact phrase matching is standard fare for all basic email filters, but lacks expandability.  With even the most basic ML tools you can can scan for phrases which resemble those found on a list.  It wouldn't take a lot of effort to surmise that this email is trying to sell you something,  they've misspelled loads of words, and have hidden characters from MS Word(or whatever else).

All of the third party email filters I'm aware of perform checks which are rudimentary in nature.  They're easily overwhelmed by low-effort changes made by scammers.  I know many services like Gmail or Outlook online perform advanced filtering, but it takes little effort for a scammer to sign up for a free account at one of these services and try stuff until an unblocked email arrives.  User configured filters would be much harder to overcome, because the exact methodology is hidden from the sender, and it would be different from one user to another.  For example I have a firm rule that I never work with a company who has sent me unsolicited email. Whereas another user might have a more flexible approach and wish to receive marketing emails only from specific senders like: Amazon, Tesla, etc

One example of a user-configured filter string could be something like this:

If:

* The sender has no public facing website
* And
   * You've never sent an email to this domain before
   * The email contains content which originates from another domain
* Or
   * subject contains any (\_2\_) (\_phrases\_) from (\_scam\_email\_content\_list\_)
   * And
      * The email contains a tracking pixel
      * Header (\_value\_) contains (\_word\_) from (\_list\_)

Then:

* Block domain for (\_6\_) (\_months\_)
* And
   * Move to: (\_scam\_) folder
   * Mark (\_read\_)
   * Notify (\_me\_) by (\_follow\_up\_email\_) in (\_6\_)(\_months\_)

&#x200B;

Filters should be toggled off and on.  For example if a user is actively searching for a job then they may wish to receive emails who's subject contains: 'LinkedIn' or 'Linked In'.  Whereas if a user is not actively searching for a job these emails become quickly overwhelming. This filter could be toggled off until the user is ready to entertain job offers and then be toggled on for a period of time.

In order for this to be effective I think there would have to be a user-consumable log which allowed the user to perform subtle tweaks on a message by message basis.  For example: if the user wants to block all email from gmail but wishes to whitelist a specific address, they could do this from the log.

These are just my two cents, Im curious what you all think.",s74jaw
An app for tutors to immediately explain a concept/question to a student one on one,3,"So I have an idea for this app that is kind of like Upwork, where you post a job and proposals start coming in. Except its a bit more casual, as its just students posting questions and tutors jumping in to explain it to them. Someone signs in as a tutor, inputs what kind of information they specialize in, and what their charging rate is. Students sign in to a profile, input a payment method, and start asking questions. Tutors then start receiving leads that are student questions pertaining to the information they specialize in. They have the option to take the lead, or pass it. If the students are satisfied with the tutors help, they give them a five star rating, and the tutor gets paid. Just to clarify, this isn't long term, in depth help. Just short and easy personalized help from a qualified tutor.",s6guad

Could an extension effect a mouse click on a video + perform a ""previous page"" operation on the browser + then perform a ""next page"" operation on the browser all at once?

The key feature is that it only turns on when the CO2 level is high, and be airtight when it's off.  This would regulate a room's CO2/oxygen balance, but also prevent the window being open all the time in the cold winter months.

I messed up so bad......,2,"This time every year low income Americans- with children- get another chance. They get a large lump sum from the government and take care of everything they have been running from since all year and get themselves up to an almost comfortable financial position. I work hard and look forward to my income tax return to give me a boost and help me make ends meet. To buy new furniture or to take my kids on a move little trip or a few outings.   I have done this every year for ten years. I work hard, always have. Last year we planned a big move out of the city and into the Midwest We took my family away from the hell that is south philly to a nice, large, comfortable home in the Midwest so I could be with the family I left behind in 1998. 
I knew the year would be hard, but my family needed the move. I barely grazed the $25,000 mark and I pushed off every bill I could push off.  We underestimated how much a cross country move would cost and we also underestimated how much it would cost to furnish a house 5 times the size of our little row home in Philly. We exhausted every cent of our savings and started skipping what bills we could put off until the highly anticipated time: Income tax refund time. Among those bills that got pushed off were my the dreaded student loan bills. 
Now, the most ironic part about me owing student loans is I have narcolepsy, so I have attempted college 6 times. I tried so hard and failed out every single time. The most recent time was with Grand Canyon University. For substance abuse and addiction studies. They would send me large refund checks $1500-$2000 at a time, four checks to be exact. I made straight A’s and at 62% completion I failed a math class. They charged me $1900 for the class – of which they had already sent me via a check and told me if I did not pay it, I could not finish classes, nor could I claim any of the classes I had taken and passed. I still had nothing to show for what I had done even though I worked so hard and did so well. I went through all the steps to get my loans discharged due to my narcolepsy being so severe and I gave up on college altogether. I took yet another low paying job and I work evenings and weekends to show them I am serious about the position in hopes of getting a raise at my 1-year mark. 
The student loans dropped off my credit report back in October and I thought I was safe to go ahead, and file taxes and I started making plans for the $6,628 that I was supposed to receive. I had it all planned out. I was going to use $2500 of it to catch up on bills (I have a $600 gas bill that is waiting and we are already behind one month on the mortgage, I also have about $500 in credit card payments that are just days away from going into collections and smashing my already low credit), $800 to get my incapacitated mother from the nursing home in Philadelphia where I left her, $300 for my sons birthday, $300 for Easter, $200 for each little boy and a spring/summer wardrobe. I signed them up for baseball and summer camp and they are waiting to be paid. I never got an offset notice form in the mail. They said they mailed it to my Philadelphia address. The student loan website says my loans defaulted in December 2019. I thought surely, they would garnish my wages first or maybe take half my income tax refund this year half next. I was already low income; my kids’ father is on childhood disability and even has a nighttime gig working under the table. I thought – “there is no way they can take it all. It is my lifeline. I need it. My kids need it. 

Sure, enough I check the “where’s my refund” website when it was a week late and it gave me the news. ""Your refund has been partially or totally taken in the amount of 6,628 to pay a federal debt"". I called the offset line and they gave me the news. Your refund has been offset in the amount of $6,628. I cried and threw up at the same time. I have heard of this happening to people. I knew it was a possibility. I know there are so many people who know what a large amount $6,628 is and how life changing it can be.  The gas will be shut off, the car up for repo, my kids won’t be able to go to camp, all my debts will be sent into collections. My mother will stay in Philadelphia where no one talks to her because she can’t talk back, where she has to have strangers give her baths and she never sees one familiar face. 

My 8-year-old went to school in pants that were size 5T today and I gave up all hope. Now dragging myself out of bed is a struggle I have let my family down; I have taken money right from their mouth. All because I wanted to go to stupid college to possibly do better for them. I should have known better the to try. I should have known better then to take the money Grand Canyon university was sending me because I should have known I would never complete a degree program to its entirety. 

People will tell you that money can’t buy happiness that life is more than just money. Well, coming from a low wage earner and a mother of a low-income family having my bills paid would make me very happy. Having a credit score above 500 would make me happy. My 8-year-old not going to school in pants that are size 5T would make me incredibly happy. Getting my mother home to the family who loves her and seeing her meet her great grand children for the first time would make me happy. $6,628 is a huge amount of money to someone like me and I don’t know how to get my life in order without it. I have no options. My $800 pay checks every two weeks are nothing. I feel like not even going back to my stupid job what is the point? I am replaceable anyway.  I make mistakes and I am not even that nice to people. I have a budget all planned and I thought to myself …… If I can just catch up.

 With my tax money I will catch up and I will be in a better place. It was a lie. A joke and the government decided to take it to pay a debt probably because they knew I was discharging the loan due to a disability and they wanted to take it while they could get it. I am lost. I feel like crawling into bed and never getting out. If I had money to buy something to help me die I probably would. My life is to far in shambles to get it back. Might as well not even be here. Now tell me money can’t buy happiness because it sure as shit could buy mine",fb68at

Supporting Black Owned UK/US Businesses,0,"Hi guys, 

New member here. 

For the past couple of days I've been doing research into black owned businesses and how disadvantaged they are to their white counterparts in terms of funding from banks, education, network links, narrative...etc. I've been slowly working up an idea of how to provide some help to these businesses and not make it so hard for them to grow due to systematic barriers in US especially, for example creating an emailing list that showcases black businesses to people that sign-up, but I don't think it will address the problem directly. There are some businesses that do this already, for example [Afrolyft](https://afrolift.com/) and [Black2Business](https://black2business.uk/) (the main ones) by showcasing black businesses on their website to the public but I do think it's slightly passive and a bit more can be done.

I am fully aware that a small program/start-up/Online tool only tinkers at the edges of why these black businesses struggle to succeed, but I wanted to make a small difference in my own way by tackling the disadvantages above.

Any black business owners have any advice on something like this? or redditors in general? I really want to get his solution right so ANY feedback on things to look out for \`would be appreciated.",s7efrn

As the title goes: Wouldn't this proposition seem reasonable and in line with current facts? Perhaps not, perhaps I'm missing something. Nonetheless, there seems to be some points of reference to take into consideration when judging the validity of this claim:

* Extreme cases of *normal* phenomena are what in many cases typify disorders, take the trait conscientiousness as an example. Normal levels of conscientiousness go down and up to a certain threshhold. Over the threshhold, abnormally high levels of conscientiousness may instigate OCD.
* IQ naturally declines as we age
* People vary in IQ. Jordan Peterson was born with \~160 IQ, but it has declined to \~145 at age \~60. That's a 15 point decrease; a decline of 10%. He's been physically active, and taken care of himself in a manner that in principle maximally minimizes age-associated cognitive decline.
* If someone, instead of doing everything ""right"", were to do everything ""wrong"", what level of decline can we anticipate? It should of course be higher than 10%, it could probably be 20%, but let's say 15% instead.
* If someone, instead of being born with an IQ of 145, were to be born with an IQ of 55 (which is as probable as being born with an IQ of 145; 0.1%), then what would the decline look like?
* 15% of 55 is 8.25, so let's say an 8 point decline.
* However, this 8 point decline is only up until the age of 60, as we took Jordan Peterson's decline and age into account. The rate of decline (-IQ%/year) is estimated to be 0.00267857142 (0.02%)  (=(15/160)/(35=*the number of years Jordan Peterson's IQ has declined for (since25)*).

&#x200B;

* We may assume the same rate after 60. This would mean that Jordan Peterson would lose an additional 8.4 IQ points until he turns 80.
* We can therefore conclude that *the* *average* person who's born with an IQ of 55, will, on average, experience a decline of \~10 points

Ok, I know it's jumbled. I have to post this now because I feel that I must admit that I've quasi-productively procrastinated by writing this, instead of packing my baggage... I'll get back on it.",s6jz4j
Unknown Light Bulb,20,"Hello,

As a preface: for some reason I can’t post photos here. 

I’m hoping to enlist my fellow Redditors in identifying, and potentially procuring, what must be an antiquated luminaire. 

It’s from a credenza/hutch that I bought at an estate sale and is from, I’m guessing, the 1950’s or 1960’s. Two of these bulbs were mounted behind a valance at the top of the credenza. 

The bulb itself is incandescent. A series of filaments are strung together between identical contacts at both ends. The contacts have what look like (1) glass pin but I can’t quite make it out. There are also no markings on the bulb. It measures 12” in length by 1” in diameter. 

I couldn’t find anything like it on Google. I can certainly replace the fixtures with LED’s but I’d like to keep them as original if possible. I only have one of two needed bulbs but the bulb I have still works decades later. 

Any guidance would be appreciated!",s6icp0
"If you're in need of inspiration, here are 5 app ideas (generated 100% by GPT-3)",10,"I like playing around with GPT-3 and then sharing the generated app ideas with people (and also trying to [make a side-project](https://ideabot.io) out of it). 

Below I'll share 5 ideas that were generated by GPT-3 (some of them needed some editing on my part to make sense, but the initial concepts are from an AI):

# 1. FeedbackMarket - A place for developers and founders to show off their work and get feedback in exchange for giving others feedback.

# 2. SmallCosplay - A site that ships costumes in small packages. With the rise of cosplay culture around the world, there are more and more people who want to dress up as their favorite characters. However, most costumes are too large to be shipped in small packages. SmallCosplay is a site that solves this problem by creating an online store for custom-made costumes that can fit in small packages.

# 3. A platform that'd help marketers and brands to find small influencers for a cheap price to promote their product.

# 4. Inspirator - A site that generates web design inspiration. Inspirator is built to help you generate ideas when you're stuck on a new project. An AI system finds similar websites in your niche, which should give you some fresh ideas.

# 5. SmartProductivity - A tool to track your productivity over time and get personalized reports. The problem: You want to be productive, but you don't know if you're on track. So many tools claim to help, but they all seem too complicated. SmartProductivity was built for the sole purpose of tracking your productivity overtime in an easy-to-understand format.

If you like any of it or get inspired, please feel free to build it and share it with me cause that'd make my day!

Happy building everyone",s5ojjh
We need a major competitor to youtube,107,"Hopefully, this isn't too malaligned with this thread as I'm actually wondering what the details of this idea might entail.

Anyways, Ideally, it'd be one with less corporate and political bias and less moderation of otherwise legitimate content (aside from violence and nudity obviously - Why can't that be where the line is?)

How difficult would it be logistically to recreate youtube with say 1080p@30fps limitations? Couldn't you just rent the necessary servers using ad space to grow over time? Even having some second legitimate contender I feel would help create a space for competition around appropriate moderation algorithms no? The biggest issue I can foresee is that you'd likely need to use google ads to promote this service and the lkelyhood of that being successful are certainly 0. And that you'd need to create an advertisement embedding engine and find businesses interested in advertising - which you'd first need an audience to sell to them.

That is all - TLDR; How might this be achieved, and what would be necessary to do so?",s5nh6p
